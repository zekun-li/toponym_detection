			Introduction
		</h3>
		
<P> ACE 2005 English SpatialML Annotations Version 2, Linguistic Data Consortium 
  (LDC) catalog number LDC2011T02 and isbn 1-58563-573-1, was developed by researchers 
  at <a href ="http://www.mitre.org/">The MITRE Corporation</a> and applies SpatialML 
  tags to the English newswire and broadcast training data annotated for entities, 
  relations and events in <a href ="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2006T06"> 
  ACE 2005 Multilingual Training Corpus LDC2006T06</a>. This second version eliminates 
  a number of annotation inconsistencies and errors identified in <a href ="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2008T03">ACE 
  2005 English SpatialML Annotations LDC2008T03</a>. In addition, the SpatialML 
  annotation schema has been updated from version 2.0 to version 3.0.1; the revised 
  annotation guidelines are included in this release. </P>
<P>The ACE (Automatic Content Extraction) program focused on developing automatic 
  content extraction technology to support automatic processing of human language 
  in text form., specifically, entities, values, temporal expressions, relations 
  and events. SpatialML is a mark-up language for representing spatial expressions 
  in natural language documents. It is intended to emulate earlier progress on 
  time expression such as <a href="http://fofoca.mitre.org/">TIMEX2</a>, <a href="http://timeml.org/site/index.html">TimeML</a>, and
  the <a href="http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig//tests/ace/2005/doc/ace05eval_official_results_20060110.html">2005 ACE guidelines</a>.</P>
<P>SpatialML includes syntax for marking up PLACEs mentioned in text and for linking 
  them to data from gazetteers and other databases. LINKs are used to express 
  relations between places, and RLINKs to capture trajectories for relative locations. 
  To the extent possible, SpatialML leverages ISO and other standards with the 
  goal of making the scheme compatible with existing and future corpora. SpatialML 
  goes beyond these schemes, however, in terms of providing a richer markup for 
  natural language that includes semantic features and relationships that allow 
  mapping to existing resources such as gazetteers. Such markup can be useful 
  for disambiguation, integration with mapping services and spatial reasoning.</P>
<h3> Data <span style="font-weight: normal;"></span> </h3>
		
<p> This corpus contains 210065 total words and 17821 unique words. Counts of 
  unique words can be found in doc/ldc_wordcount.csv which includes all words 
  that are not part of XML markup (e.g., without tag names, attribute names or 
  values). Unique words are counted by comparing case insensitive transformations 
  with preceding and trailing punctuation stripped off. &quot;Words&quot; consisting 
  solely of punctuation are discarded. 
<p>The principal change in the annotation schema is that &quot;PATH&quot; has 
  been generalized to &quot;RLINK&quot; for relative link. At the top level, there 
  is now a version attribute on the root SpatialML tag to capture which version 
  of SpatialML was used. A number of smaller changes have been made to the annotation 
  specification; these are listed in Section 2 of the updated guidelines.
<p>The files are provided in both in-line xml format and aif format. 
<P> The gaz-deref files contain multiple gazetteer references when they exist 
  for a single location; these different gazrefs sometimes correspond to slightly 
  different latlongs. The sgm.dtd validated files do not contain document structure 
  tags (such as &lt;DOC&gt;, &lt;TXT&gt;) that would prevent them from being validated 
  with the SpatialML DTD. These files total 22624650 bytes uncompressed. </P>
