5. Death of Arafat (1) Controversial PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in
a <PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-1427981 IGDB:18572019" id="Pl-1" latLong="46.000°N 2.000°E" predicative="true" state="FR-75" type="PPLC">Paris</PLACE> <PLACE country="FR" form="NOM" id="Pl-190" state="FR-75" type="FAC">hospital</PLACE> last week.  Do you think Arafat's death will help or
hurt the <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725 NGA:-780275" id="Pl-2" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Israeli</PLACE>-<PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-7" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Palestinian</PLACE> peace process?  Was Arafat a good leader?
What do you think <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-11" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> policy should be toward <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-9" type="COUNTRY">Palestine</PLACE> now that Arafat
has died? What, if anything, should the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-10" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> do to be involved in the
<PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208667208" id="Pl-15" predicative="true" type="RGN">Middle East</PLACE> peace process?


 Gandhi 
Hi, good evening.


 Marco 
Hi. Wha- I didn't catch your name. What's your name?


 Gandhi 
Gandhi from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-17" state="US-NY">New York</PLACE>. You?


 Marco 
Gindhi?


 Gandhi 
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-18" state="US-NY">New York</PLACE>. Yeah.


 Marco 
From <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-19" state="US-NY">New York</PLACE>.


 Gandhi 
Yeah.


 Marco 
Uh, Marco from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779784 IGDB:1780784" id="Pl-20" latLong="40.000°N 89.250°W" state="US-IL" type="CIVIL">Illinois</PLACE>.


 Gandhi 
Okay, Mark. Uh,  I think it's fresh topic for tonight.


 Marco 
Yeah, yeah. Good topic. It's a good topic.


 Gandhi 
So what do you think?


 Marco 
Well,  um, I would- I would have to start- -- I would have to start,
generally, in stating- -- stating what I think is the problem and -- -with
the <PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208667208" id="Pl-16" type="COUNTRY">Middle East</PLACE> and what- For me, one of the major problems is the
fact that -- the -- <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-12" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> government gives so much aid to the
state of <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725 NGA:-780275" id="Pl-4" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE>.  In which,  the state of <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725 NGA:-780275" id="Pl-5" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> buys -- many expensive
military weapons,  ah, which is used to -- oppress and -- to kill a lot of
Palestinians.  So, for me, that's -- the- that's essentially the root of
the problem.  And, um, Yasser Arafat was kind of in a difficult
position, because you have these,  um, incredibly -- oppressed and in
some ways imprisoned,  uh, Palestinians,  and if -- Arafat hadn't, um,
tried to stand up -- and help them and- and fight for their rights,
then -- m- they wouldn't have respected Arafat,  but then again, you
know, he couldn't be too friendly with the West,  um,  and, um, and
so he did the best he could, I think. It's a difficult -- leadership
role.


 Gandhi 
Mhm.


 Marco 
Yeah.  Um,  what do- Well, how about you?


 Gandhi 
I think,  yeah, more or less, I c- I agree with what you said. It's
almost, this is my view as well.  And the question is,  what next?  I
mean,  some idea -- from <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725 NGA:-780275" id="Pl-3" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Israeli</PLACE> side, they were saying -- he was a
problem,  and if he goes, everything will be quite easy.


 Marco 
Yeah.


 Gandhi 
Fine.  Now he's not in anymore.


 Marco 
Yeah.


 Gandhi 
So, let us wait and see.  Hope.  If he was a problem himself,  hope
-uh,  the coming one -- will be in a good -- position to negotiate with
the other side, <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725 NGA:-780275" id="Pl-6" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE>, and then -- peace can be achieved.


 Marco 
Yeah.


 Gandhi 
Uh,  we have to wait and see, but,  uh,  it seems it's not easy.


 Marco 
But, I,  eh, I get the feeling that- -- It's almost- -- The peace process-
We can't put it on -- the ro- or the- -- the whole responsibility of the
pre- -- peace process can't be the leader of -- a- -- a group that is- -- I
don't know, in my view,  has -- not ver- not very many resources to
fight- -- to fight this -- battle that -- their trying to fight against -- a
government that has taken away a lot of their land,  that,  you know,
doesn't allow them to really move around in their own <PLACE country="IL" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:19219725 NGA:-780275" id="Pl-21" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>.  So,
unless that -- stops,  the, um,  the leader of the Palestinians -- really
can't do too much -- to further the peace process, because -- there are -- a
lot of bad things happening to the people -- of that -- leader.


 Gandhi 
That's correct, as well.


 Marco 
Yeah, so it's- -- it's kind of, it's- -- it seems like the, um,  the
media, at least in the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-13" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE>, is -- putting all of this -- focus
and responsibility on the leader of the Palestinians, as if it was


 Gandhi 


 Marco 
Arafat's fault that any of- -- any of the violence was caused.  So,  it
seems like an unfair treatment -- of- -- of,  you know, the leader of -- the
<PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-8" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Palestinian</PLACE> people.  Um,  yeah.


 Gandhi 
Yes. That's absolutely correct. Yeah.


 Marco 
Yeah.  Hm.


 Gandhi 
Actually, it- it's a good topic to be choosing, I mean,  uh, because
it's one of the fresh topics.


 Marco 
Yeah.


 Gandhi 
How long have you been with the study?


 Marco 
Uh, this is probably my tenth or eleventh conversation.


 Gandhi 
Tenth, eleven. Almost the same like me. So, the other -- days, which one
was quite interesting to you?


 Marco 
Um,  well, there's been a couple where -- they've- they talked about the
Cabinet -- for -- Bush, and Bush has been,  um,  you know,  selecting new
Cabinet members and -- all of the new members are people that I'm- I
don't really know very well.  So, there's been some topics where I'm-
I didn't have very much information.  Other topics -- you know, usually
about the election that- -- that, um,  I did have -- a lot of things,  um,
to say.  Yeah.  Are you- are you, um,  are you from the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-14" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE>,
or do you come from, uh-


 Gandhi 
I came from the area, I'm from <PLACE country="EG" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19706664 NGA:-293336" id="Pl-22" latLong="27.000°N 30.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Egypt</PLACE>.


 Marco 
You're from <PLACE country="EG" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19706664 NGA:-293336" id="Pl-23" latLong="27.000°N 30.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Egypt</PLACE>.


 Gandhi 
Yeah, so I'm- I'm quite, uh,


 Marco 
So you-


 Gandhi 
-cerned about, uh- -- uh, over there I mean.  People, actually, they are
waiting -- to, uh, to see peace is a fact.  Actually, in both sides,


 Marco 
Yeah.
