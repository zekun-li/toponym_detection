<PLACE country="MY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17594843 NGA:-2405157" id="Pl-1" latLong="2.500°N 112.500°E" type="COUNTRY">Malaysia</PLACE>'s prison department has agreed to allow jailed politician
Anwar Ibrahim to attend his daughter's wedding ceremony Friday after
his bail hearing, his lawyer said Thursday.

Anwar will be taken to the appeal court early Friday for a bail
application pending his appeal to the country's highest Federal Court
againt his sodomy conviction, counsel Sankara Nair said.

Prison authorities have given the nod for Anwar to be taken <PLACE continent="AI" country="MY" form="NOM" id="P-4" type="FAC">home</PLACE>
later in the afternoon to marry his eldest daughter, Nurul Izzah, to
engineer Raja Ahmad Sharir Iskandar in a traditional <PLACE country="MY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17594843 NGA:-2405157" id="Pl-2" latLong="2.500°N 112.500°E" type="COUNTRY">Malay</PLACE> ceremony,
he said.

But this is also conditional on police approval.

&quot;They have to get the green light from police. We have given an
assurance that there will not be a huge crowd at the <PLACE continent="AI" country="MY" form="NOM" id="P-5" type="FAC">house</PLACE> as the
guests will only comprise of family members,&quot; he added.

The former deputy premier, sacked by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
in 1998, was sentenced to a total 15 years in jail after being
convicted of corruption and sodomy.

He completed four years in prison on a corruption charge last month
and is now serving a nine-year sodomy sentence. He lost an appeal
case on his sodomy sentence on April 18. Another appeal is now
pending in the Federal Court.

Anwar, 56, says he was framed to prevent him from becoming a
political threat to Mahathir, an allegation the government denies.
