<PLACE country="MY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17596990" id="Pl-4" latLong="3.167°N 101.700°E" state="14" type="PPLC">KUALA LUMPUR</PLACE>, April 18 (AFP)

<PLACE country="MY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17594843" id="Pl-2" latLong="2.500°N 112.500°E" type="COUNTRY">Malaysia</PLACE>'s Appeal Court Friday refused to overturn the conviction and
nine-year jail sentence imposed on ex-deputy prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim for sodomy.

Anwar, 56, who this week completed four years in prison on a
corruption charge, now faces an earliest possible release date of
April 14, 2009 if he is given one third remission of his sentence for
good behaviour.

The former heir-apparent to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who says
he was framed for political reasons, told reporters after his appeal
was rejected: &quot;You must remember its pre-selected judges, most junior
of the court of appeal, and its all scripted.

&quot;What do you expect?&quot;

Mahathir's sacking of the charismatic and popular Anwar in September
1998 rocked <PLACE country="MY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17594843" id="Pl-3" latLong="2.500°N 112.500°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Malaysian</PLACE> politics, with thousands of people taking to
the streets to demonstrate their support for him.

Within weeks he was arrested and charged with sodomising an official
driver several years previously and with abusing his powers to cover
up the offence.

The conduct of the trials was widely criticised internationally and
the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> still lists Anwar as a political prisoner.

Anwar was told Monday that he had been granted a standard one-third
remission of a six-year corruption sentence for good behaviour, and
immediately began to serve the nine-year sentence for sodomy.
