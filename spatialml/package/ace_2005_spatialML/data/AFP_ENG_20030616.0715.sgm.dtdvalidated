<PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-12" state="US-WI" type="FAC">home</PLACE> where a 22-year-old woman's dead infant was discovered in a blue

Kristin Scott, the mother, told police she gave birth secretly to
both babies at her parents' <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-13" state="US-WI" type="FAC">home</PLACE> in <PLACE country="US" county="Richland County" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1563494" id="Pl-5" latLong="43.220°N 90.548°W" state="WI" type="PPL">Byrds Creek</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1582112" id="Pl-6" latLong="43.383°N 90.433°W" state="WI" type="CIVIL">Richland County</PLACE>, one
of unknown sex in April 2001 and the other, a fullterm girl, January
14.

Police arrested her in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1330173" id="Pl-8" latLong="32.449°N 99.733°W" state="TX" type="PPL">Abilene</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780801" id="Pl-7" latLong="31.250°N 99.250°W" state="TX" type="CIVIL">Texas</PLACE>, Saturday where she had moved

She is being held on 50,000 dollars bail on a charge of first-degree
reckless homicide and hiding a corpse in the death of the infant born

Scott told police she did not tend to the baby, and it died after 30
minutes. She said the baby had to die, according to the criminal
complaint.

The woman's parents, William and Nancy Scott, found the decomposing
body of the first baby in her closet after they went looking for the
source of a foul odor in their house.
