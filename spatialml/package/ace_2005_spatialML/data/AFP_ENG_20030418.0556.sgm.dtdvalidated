Best-selling novelist and &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; creator Michael Crichton
has agreed to pay his fourth wife 31 million dollars as part of their
divorce settlement, court documents showed Friday.

Crichton, 60, is one of the world's wealthiest authors, and has had
12 of his novels made into major <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1661757" id="Pl-4" latLong="34.098°N 118.326°W" predicative="true" state="US-CA" type="PPL">Hollywood</PLACE> movies.

The writer will retain the rights to his books and films, although he
has agreed to split a raft of other possessions with Anne Marie, his
wife of 13 years, according to documents filed in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1663328" id="Pl-2" latLong="34.052°N 118.243°W" predicative="true" state="US-CA" type="PPL">Los Angeles</PLACE>
Superior Court.

which was on the  market last year for 21.5 million dollars, as well
as their fine art collection.

Crichton, a Harvard Medical School graduate, will keep a <PLACE continent="NA" country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-9" state="US-CA" type="FAC">home</PLACE> in

Before the divorce, Crichton's fortune was estimated at 65 million
dollars, built on such hit novels as &quot;The Andromeda Strain,&quot; &quot;The
Great <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-7" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> Train Robbery&quot; and &quot;Westworld&quot; and his hit television

rights to his latest book, &quot;Prey,&quot; and has a 30-million-dollar,
two-book deal with publishers Harper Collins.

Anne-Marie sued Crichton for divorce in September after their
marriage broke down.
