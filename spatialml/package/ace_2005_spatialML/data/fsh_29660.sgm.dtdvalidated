 Julia 
Do do you have, uh, eh, d- are you worried about crime where you are?


 Laura 
Oh yeah. I'm always worried about crime. My my dad is a um is a
retired police officer, so he's at a pretty young age, he um, he
pretty much put these, you know, the worries in my in my head at
at -- starting at a young age, you know.


 Julia 
Oh, of course.


 Laura 
Yeah, so I -- and I have, uh, five children and I worry about, um, you
know, kidnapping and I I worry about that ki- child abduction all
that kind of stuff all the time.


 Julia 
Yeah. Oh boy. Yeah, I have I have grandchildren and I've thought about
that, you know, like, l- they say, for instance, when you -- when you
knit something for them, don't put their name on on the -- on the
garment because, you know, somebody can call them out.


 Laura 
Exactly.


 Julia 
And and this kind of thing.


 Laura 
And that's awful.


 Julia 
so it's, uh sensible, uh, stuff but it's it's sad, uh, isn't it, that
we have to go through that.


 Laura 
It's sad that we have to live like that, that we have to be in -- live
in fear like that. I mean to have to lock your doors.


 Julia 
Yeah. Yeah. I...


 Laura 
And to watch you know, around your car. It's just a shame, really.


 Julia 
Y- yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I mean, in, um, wh- where
I live it's not a bad area but there's still, I mean, I've I've
heard of instances of terrible things happening in parking lots...


 Laura 
Yeah.


 Julia 
I eh eh.


 Laura 
You know, eh, when they go off to college, and I worry about -- my
daughters and the the you know, the date rape and all.  I mean, all
that kind of stuff. It just it's just it's never ending, all the
worries that you have.


 Julia 
Oh. Oh, sure, um, sure but, uh, in in a way, as far as when
they are little because, you know, they they can be, uh, sort of
lured away and this kind of thing.


 Laura 
Yes.


 Julia 
I hate that idea that...


 Laura 
And you don't know them, I tell them just to run and I don't care if
-- you know, an- and even if it's someone who is even a good person
they would understand, you know, that that they're shouldn't be
talking to.


 Julia 
Uh, oh, of course.


 Laura 
I I mean, I probably shouldn't scare them to death but I don't want
them to even get in the vicinity of someone that they -- who tries to
c- strike up a conversation with...


 Julia 
Of course, yeah. Exactly. I mean, and they they have all this
tricks I understand, you know, like, uh, a lost puppy or a...


 Laura 
Yeah, candy or -- well, you know what?


 Julia 
Ah. Terrible.


 Laura 
I have a a -- my daughter, my one daughter, is, um, she's seven. Well,
th- la- last year I noticed, and like we ta- we go out to like, um,
uh, you know, public places like <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="P-86" type="FAC">Great Times</PLACE> which is a place where,
um, kids, teenagers and kids, there's lots of arcade games and stuff
like that, and around about age of six, she got a lot of stares, eh,
from older men.  And I would notice that. I -- one time in particular
at that place I told you about. And, um, yeah, they sh- th- so, I
mean, pe- I would just notice guys, older men just, like, staring at
her.


 Julia 
Uh-huh.


 Laura 
An- and I -- it made me very uncomfortable, you know.


 Julia 
Oh my God. I can imagine, yeah.


 Laura 
An- and none of my other kids I've noticed that with. It's just her
and...


 Julia 
Terrible. Yeah, well, maybe you're m- more attuned to it now-
nowadays, you know, because...


 Laura 


 Julia 
Yeah.


 Laura 
But I've got -- well, I've got younger than her, though. I've got
a four-year-old son and then I have a newbor- new baby, too, but, um,
it just, uh, that's just unsettling. It's just unsettling that there
are people out th- out there in the world that...


 Julia 
Uh-huh.


 Laura 
Me being an ex-co- you know, my dad's, eh -- you know, I'm always
aware. I'm always aro- aware of my surroundings around me. I'm not --
I don't...


 Julia 
Oh, I see. He your dad really woke you up to all that.


 Laura 
Yes, he did. An- and it's kind o- it's k- it's kind of -- it kind of
used to upset me but now I'm...


 Julia 
That's that's good.


 Laura 
I always lock my doors. I always lock my doors even when I'm driving.
As soon as I get in the car...


 Julia 
Right.


 Laura 
Um, I've I have this bi- big van, I- I look in that. You know, I
I I wo- -- I used to carry, um, pepper spray, you know, I mean,
everything just just because eh, you just never know.


 Julia 
Eh, do you --


 Laura 
And I --


 Julia 
You think it works? I mean, is that useful?


 Laura 
Um, w- with me being aware, I I think it probably helps because -- I don't,
like I said, I don't ever put myself in bad situations and it seems
like most people who who, eh, get kidnapped -- that are kidnapped
or abducted or whatever, it seems like they are -- they -- they're in
bad sa- situations. They they're in bad places.


 Julia 
Right. Right.


 Laura 
You know, alleys and alone.
