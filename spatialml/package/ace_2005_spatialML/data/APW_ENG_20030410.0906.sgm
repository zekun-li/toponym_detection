<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>'s U.N. Ambassador Mohammed Al-Douri, the first <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> official to
concede defeat in the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE>-led war, met privately with
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, but refused to talk about rumors that
he was planning to leave <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-23" latLong="40.714Â°N 74.006Â°W" state="NY" type="PPL">New York</PLACE>.

``I am sorry,'' he said. ``No Answer.''

``No comment at all. This is my last word to you,'' he told hordes of
journalists who chased him Thursday at his <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-24" latLong="40.714Â°N 74.006Â°W" state="NY" type="PPL">New York</PLACE> <PLACE id="Pl-526" type="FAC">residence</PLACE> and
U.N. <PLACE id="Pl-530" type="FAC">headquarters</PLACE> seeking comment on his talks with the
secretary-general, his future and the war.

Asked who should govern <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, Al-Douri said: ``I have nothing to do
with that.''

Annan also declined to comment on Thursday's meeting with Al-Douri.

With the fall of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-28" latLong="33.339Â°N 44.394Â°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> Wednesday, Al-Douri declared ``the game is
over'' and expressed hope that the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-7" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> people will now be able to
live in peace. He said he had not been in touch with <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-29" latLong="33.339Â°N 44.394Â°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>.

Beside meeting with Annan, Al-Douri spent several hours during the
late morning and afternoon meeting with ambassadors and diplomats in
the <PLACE id="Pl-527" type="FAC">Delegate's Lounge</PLACE>.


``I wished him good luck but I don't know what he said to the
secretary-general and what will be his next steps,'' said Arab League
Secretary-General Amr Moussa, who talked with Al-Douri before his own
meeting with Annan.

In an interview with The Associated Press Wednesday night, Al-Douri
said he will continue to work at the United Nations and had no
intention of defecting.

``Defecting from who?'' he asked. ``I think the government has
already defected. There is no more <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-8" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> government to be defected
from.''

Annan said early Thursday  _  before meeting Al-Douri  _  that in
talks with the envoy Monday, ``he didn't ask for an asylum or
protection ... (and) he didn't ask me for help with his status.''

``We did talk about what happens, depending on the evolution of
things on the ground,'' Annan said.

The ambassador had vehemently defended his <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-17" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> for months as the
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-21" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> and its allies sought U.N. backing for war on <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-9" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>.
Privately, many U.N. diplomats see him as a respectable colleague.

``I sympathize with his need to create a new life for himself,'' said
<PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-31" latLong="54.000Â°N 4.000Â°W" type="COUNTRY">Britain</PLACE>'s U.N. Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock.

Al-Douri taught international law at <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-30" latLong="33.339Â°N 44.394Â°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> University for over 30
years before becoming a diplomat in 1999, first at the <PLACE id="Pl-528" type="FAC">United Nations</PLACE>

in <PLACE country="CH" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17447849" id="Pl-32" latLong="46.200Â°N 6.167Â°E" state="GE" type="PPLA">Geneva</PLACE> and since early 2001 at U.N. <PLACE id="Pl-532" type="FAC">headquarters</PLACE> in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-25" latLong="40.714Â°N 74.006Â°W" state="NY" type="PPL">New York</PLACE>.

He said in the AP interview he would love to return to teaching but
for now he plans to remain at the United Nations. ``Things will be
crystalized one day,'' he said.

``What I worried about is that things are settled in the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-18" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> ...
so in the future the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-10" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> people will live in peace without
sanctions, without wars, without suffering. This is my message.''

Separately, lawyers who claim that <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-11" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> helped plan the 1995 <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1103140" id="Pl-27" latLong="35.468Â°N 97.516Â°W" predicative="true" state="OK" type="PPL">Oklahoma
City</PLACE> bombing that killed 168 people asked a judge at a federal <PLACE id="Pl-529" type="FAC">court</PLACE>
in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-26" latLong="40.714Â°N 74.006Â°W" state="NY" type="PPL">New York</PLACE> to force Al-Douri to testify in the case and hold the
envoy in contempt, saying they worry that he would flee the <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-20" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>.

But U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Al-Douri still has diplomatic
immunity as <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-12" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>'s ambassador. Under U.N. rules, a new <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE>
government would have to ask to represent the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-19" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>, which the
General Assembly would then consider.

``He is still <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-14" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>'s ambassador at the United Nations,'' White House
spokesman Ari Fleischer said in Washington. ``Legally, that is the
way it works at the U.N.''

Larry Klayman, chairman of Judicial Watch, which represent 14
survivors and victims' relatives who have filed a $1.5 billion
federal lawsuit against <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-15" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-33" latLong="38.895Â°N 77.037Â°W" state="DC" type="PPLC">Washington</PLACE>, said his organization had
served a subpoena on Al-Douri twice, on March 26 and March 28, but
said he has not responded.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> District Judge John S. Martin did not immediately rule but
scheduled a hearing for next week.

The April 19, 1995, bombing of the <PLACE id="Pl-533" type="FAC">Alfred P. Murrah federal building</PLACE>

was the deadliest terrorist strike on <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-22" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> soil at the time. The
suit claims <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-16" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> officials provided money and training to convicted
bomber Timothy McVeigh and conspirator Terry Nichols. McVeigh was
executed in 2001, and Nichols is serving a life sentence.
