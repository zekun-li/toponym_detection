SOUTH OF <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-14" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" mod="S" state="BG" type="PPLC">BAGHDAD</PLACE>, <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-37" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> (AP)

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> soldiers moved to capture <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-15" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>'s <PLACE id="Pl-461" type="FAC">Saddam International Airport</PLACE>
early Friday and fought running battles with <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-23" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> defenders along
the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-38" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" mod="S" state="BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE>'s southern fringes. ``A vise is closing on the regime,''
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> President George W. Bush said.

Some frontline units went on heightened alert against the threat of
chemical weapons, ordered to wear rubber boots and suits despite
temperatures that soared into the 90s.

There was fierce fighting in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897407" id="Pl-39" latLong="32.498°N 45.829°E" state="WA" type="PPLA">Kut</PLACE>, <SIGNAL id="S-1">to the south</SIGNAL> of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-16" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>, where
desperate Iraqis armed with rifles charged tanks in a suicide raid.
``We mowed down'' the attackers, said Lt. Col. B.P. McCoy.

Despite declarations that more tough fighting lies ahead, the top
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> military official indicated there may not be an all-out battle
for <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-17" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>. Gen. Richard Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, suggested isolating members of the old regime in the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-42" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">capital</PLACE> 
_  cut off from the rest of the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-43" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>  _  while an ``interim
administration'' is put in place to begin work on a postwar
government.

A meeting to organize an interim government could be held in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-24" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>
within a week, a senior Pentagon official said Thursday night.

For the first time in the war, large parts of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-18" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> lost
electricity. The cause was not known. Myers told reporters at a
Pentagon briefing that Americans had not targeted the power grid.

Tracer rounds lit the night sky and artillery boomed near the airport

a few kilometers (miles) from the heart of President Saddam Hussein's
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-44" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">capital</PLACE> of 5 million people.

At one stage, it appeared that <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> forces had taken control of the
<PLACE id="Pl-458" type="FAC">airport</PLACE>, ``and then it got more confusing with continued fighting,
Myers said Thursday night. Capture of the <PLACE id="Pl-457" type="FAC">airport</PLACE> would give <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-45" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE>
and <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-52" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> troops a <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="P-462" type="FAC">facility</PLACE> for airlifting equipment and troops to

Along the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-57" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" mod="S" state="BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE>'s southern edge, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> tanks and Bradley vehicles
destroyed at least seven <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-25" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> armored personnel carriers and more
than 15 <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-26" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> tanks in fighting that went on for more than four
hours.

Two weeks into the war, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-46" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> commanders reported a string of
successes  _  on the battlefield and within an <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-27" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> population
initially reluctant about embracing invading troops. Kurdish fighters
in the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-58" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="N" type="COUNTRY">north</PLACE> chipped in, when a top leader suggested they may agree
not to seek control of the northern city of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16892885" id="Pl-59" latLong="35.468°N 44.392°E" state="TS" type="PPLA">Kirkuk</PLACE>.

There were battlefield setbacks, as well. Two Marines were killed and
one injured in the close-quarters fighting in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897407" id="Pl-40" latLong="32.498°N 45.829°E" state="WA" type="PPLA">Kut</PLACE>. And an Army
soldier investigating a destroyed tank in central <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-28" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="CENTRAL" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> was killed by
friendly fire when he was mistaken for an Iraqi, the military said.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-7" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> defense officials also were investigating whether a Navy Hornet
jet that crashed Wednesday was shot down by a <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> Patriot missile.
The Navy was searching for the pilot Thursday.

The overall toll of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-47" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> troops dead passed 50, and Bush visited
a Marine <PLACE country="IQ" id="P-463" type="FAC">camp</PLACE>, which has lost 13  _  more than any other
<PLACE country="IQ" id="P-464" type="FAC">installation</PLACE>. ``He's in heaven,'' the commander in chief told the
family of one fallen Marine in a private moment.

To the cheers of thousands earlier in a speech, he vowed victory, and
said, ``A vise is closing on the regime.''

<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-29" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> officials issued the latest in a series of exhortations in
Saddam's name. ``Fight them with your hands. God will disgrace
them,'' they said, referring to invading <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-48" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> and <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-53" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> troops.

But the daily urgings seemed increasingly at odds with the military
situation across the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-60" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>, and Myers said Saddam had lost control
of 45 percent of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-30" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>'s territory.

As conventional units fought their way to the outskirts of the
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-61" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" mod="BORDER" state="BG" type="PPLC">capital</PLACE>, officials said special forces had raided the <PLACE country="IQ" id="P-465" type="FAC">Tharthar
presidential palace</PLACE> near <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16888105" id="Pl-62" latLong="34.597°N 43.677°E" state="SD" type="PPL">Tikrit</PLACE>, Saddam's hometown. Documents were
seized at the site <SIGNAL id="S-2">north</SIGNAL> of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-20" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>, said Brig. Gen. Vincent Brooks
at <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> Central Command in the Persian Gulf, but no ranking members
of the regime were found.

``That's all right, he added, ``there's other operations ongoing.''

To the far <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-63" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="N" type="COUNTRY">north</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-10" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> special forces and <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" id="Pl-73" type="RGN">Kurdish</PLACE> militiamen captured
the town of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:29125355" id="Pl-64" latLong="36.502°N 43.584°E" state="DA" type="PPL">Bardarash</PLACE> and a nearby <PLACE id="Pl-446" type="FAC">bridge</PLACE>, one of few routes into the
city of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897344" id="Pl-65" latLong="36.335°N 43.119°E" state="NI" type="PPLA">Mosul</PLACE> near government-held oil <PLACE id="Pl-450" type="FAC">fields</PLACE>. Iraqis had held the

In the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-67" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="S" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>'s southern region, <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-54" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> forces penetrated closer to
the center of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897821" id="Pl-68" latLong="30.494°N 47.819°E" mod="CENTRAL" state="BA" type="PPLA">Basra</PLACE>, and warplanes dropped 500-pound (225-kilogram)
and 1,000-pound (450-kilogram) laser-guided bombs on an <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-31" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE>
intelligence <PLACE id="Pl-453" type="FAC">complex</PLACE>. Die-hard defenders have held out for days
inside the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897821" id="Pl-69" latLong="30.494°N 47.819°E" type="COUNTRY">city</PLACE> of 1.3 million.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-49" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> officials cited continuing examples of Iraqis cooperating
with invading troops. In <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897127" id="Pl-70" latLong="31.992°N 44.351°E" state="NA" type="PPLA">Najaf</PLACE>, they said a prominent cleric under
<PLACE id="Pl-452" type="FAC">house</PLACE> arrest by the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-32" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> government had urged the population not to
interfere with the operations of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-50" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> or <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-55" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> forces.

A small group of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-33" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> defenders has been holding out inside the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897127" id="Pl-71" latLong="31.992°N 44.351°E" state="NA" type="PPLA">city</PLACE>
in a <PLACE country="IQ" id="Pl-454" type="FAC">mosque</PLACE>, considered a Shiite holy <PLACE country="IQ" id="Pl-455" type="FAC">site</PLACE>, and local clerics said
one religious leader had recently arrived in hopes of arranging for
their safe passage out of the <PLACE country="IQ" id="Pl-456" type="FAC">shrine</PLACE>.

Ground forces closed in on <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-21" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> from separate southern approaches,
the Army <SIGNAL id="S-4">from the southeast</SIGNAL> and Marines <SIGNAL id="S-3">from the southwest</SIGNAL>, in
advances begun Tuesday night.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-51" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> and <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-56" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> helicopters and planes bombed positions in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897407" id="Pl-41" latLong="32.498°N 45.829°E" state="WA" type="PPLA">Kut</PLACE>,
and Marines and Iraqis lobbed grenades at close quarters.

Between 10 and 15 Iraqis armed only with rifles charged Marine tanks
in the suicide charge. Two <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-11" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> Marines died in the fighting  _  and
a medic who tried to save one of them sorrowfully buried his
resuscitation equipment on the spot.

Army forces rolled past dozens of dead <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-34" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> soldiers and bombed-out
hulks of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-35" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> military equipment as they made their way toward
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-22" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> from the area around <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16892923" id="Pl-72" latLong="32.250°N 43.117°E" state="KA" type="CIVIL">Karbala</PLACE>. Many more <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-36" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> soldiers
surrendered to the overwhelming force of the Americans, and were
shuttled to the rear.

At the same time they worried about chemical weapons attacks, Brooks
disclosed that a special operations force in the southwestern desert
had found a number of bottles ``marked in strange ways.'' He said an
investigation was under way.
