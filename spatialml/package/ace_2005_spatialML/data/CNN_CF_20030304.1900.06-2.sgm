 NOVAK 
Question?


 CHRISTA DEMORE 
Hi. I'm Christa Demore (ph) from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:586934" id="Pl-2" latLong="39.372°N 77.272°W" state="US-MD" type="PPL">Monrovia</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1715934" id="Pl-1" latLong="39.000°N 76.750°W" state="US-MD" type="CIVIL">Maryland</PLACE>. And I'm curious, how
can Democrats claim that President Bush is ignoring the war on terror if
al Qaeda's second key operative was just caught?


 NOVAK 
And it also proves you can even chew gum and walk at the same time.
Doesn't it show that?


 BEGALA 
He cannot eat a pretzel and watch a football became at the same time. So
I'm still doubtful of -- no, here's why. This is a serious point and you
deserve a serious answer. The way we caught that guy was by coordinating
with our allies. We now have a foreign policy in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-3" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> that is putting
enormous strain on those allies. The same weekend they arrested the guy,
we had...

(CROSSTALK)

 NOVAK 
We had no part in it.


 BEGALA 
No, it was a joint effort by <PLACE country="PK" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17229029" id="Pl-6" latLong="30.000°N 70.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Pakistan</PLACE>. Why do we want to sever that
relationship with this idiotic war in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>?


 NOVAK 
We're not severing it -- question.


 BEN CHARLTON 
Hi. I'm Ben Charlton (ph) from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:626219" id="Pl-7" latLong="42.737°N 84.484°W" state="US-MI" type="PPL">East Lansing</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780789" id="Pl-8" latLong="44.250°N 85.500°W" state="US-MI" type="CIVIL">Michigan</PLACE>. I was -- if we
wait for U.N. approval for action in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, don't we sacrifice some of our
<PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">national</PLACE> sovereignty?


 NOVAK 
Well, where are all of the conservative questions? We never have
conservatives in the audience. There's no question. I think even Paul
would agree with me. The question of whether we go to war or not is
strictly a <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-10" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">national</PLACE> question. It's not a United Nations question.


 BEGALA 
That is correct. The president has got all of the legal authorities he
needs. I just pray to god he doesn't use it. We need to go to the U.N.
because we want to build coalitions so we have support around the world
and so that we don't have to carry the burden ourselves. But legally he
has no obligation to go back to the U.N. From the left I am Paul Begala.
Goodnight for CROSSFIRE.


 NOVAK 
From the right, I'm Robert Novak. Join us next time for another edition
of CROSSFIRE.
