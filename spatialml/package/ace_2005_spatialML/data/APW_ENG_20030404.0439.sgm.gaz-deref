<PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-2994055 IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-3" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Russia</PLACE> has accepted a <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>$150 million World Bank loan to combat the
spread of AIDS and tuberculosis, ending a negotiating process that
lasted four years, World Bank officials said Friday.

The World Bank first offered the loan in 1999, but disagreements over
treatment kept the project on hold. <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-2994055 IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-4" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Russia</PLACE> objected to World Bank
rules that required monitoring of patients receiving medication, the
World Bank said.

But after drawn-out talks, President Vladimir Putin signed off on the
loan, which will take effect this year, the World Bank said.

``<PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-2994055 IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-5" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Russia</PLACE> has one of the fastest growing AIDS epidemics in the world''
and has a ``fearsome'' problem with tuberculosis, particularly
drug-resistant strains, said Olesoji Adeyi, a World Bank health
specialist.

``It's a potential dual epidemic,'' he said, adding that people with
immune systems weakened by the AIDS virus are especially vulnerable
to contracting TB, which he called an ``opportunistic disease.''

AIDS came relatively late to <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-2994055 IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-6" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Russia</PLACE>, but spread rapidly, primarily
due to intravenous drug abuse and a lack of prevention programs.
Officials have registered more than 230,000 cases of HIV, though
health experts say the actual number of HIV infections tops 1
million.

Tuberculosis, meanwhile, has also emerged as a serious problem,
particularly in <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-2994055 IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-7" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Russia</PLACE>'s overcrowded prisons.
