11. Holiday Traditions: The holiday season is right around the
corner. Who do you like to celebrate with during the holidays? Do you go
to a lot of parties with friends, neighbors, co-workers or family
members? Are there people you see during the holidays that you don't see
during the rest of the year? Do you travel to meet up with family or
friends during the holidays? Where do you go and who do you visit?


 Ed 
Hi this is Ed.  good. how are you doing Jane?  if you hear noise in
the background, I'm enjoying the holiday season walking in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-1" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="US-NY" type="PPL">New York
City</PLACE>, so


 Jane 
Oh, okay.


 Ed 
((city)) -- ((trusts of life)) -- crazy people and, uh, other things going
on but that's <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-2" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="US-NY" type="PPL">New York</PLACE>, what can you say.


 Jane 
Yeah yeah yeah.  Used to live in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-3" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="US-NY" type="PPL">New York</PLACE>. My brother-in-law still
lives in the <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-4" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="US-NY" type="PPL">city</PLACE> but we were <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:978426" id="Pl-5" latLong="40.817°N 73.067°W" predicative="true" state="US-NY" type="RGN">Long Island</PLACE> people.


 Ed 
Yeah.  Uh,  so what are you doing for the festive holidays.


 Jane 
You know, it's really bad because I still really don't know. I'm up in
the air with about six different clients trying to decide what we're
going to do.


 Ed 
((Allan)) -- Well, that's not bad. That means that you've got a lot of
people to see and do things with. That's good.


 Jane 
Yeah, makes it kind of hectic. How about you? What are you doing?


 Ed 
Ah, family.


 Jane 
Ach.


 Ed 
Yeah. Yeah, we're going to be doing, uh,  the typical.  Go up and
celebrate with the family and -- be with the little kids.  You know, the
((tough years)) and that which makes it -- because when you get older
it's kind of,  I've got all the gifts, I don't need that. What I
really want to do is see somebody else enjoy it and the little kids
enjoy it.  So- -- and, uh, do a lot of parties with family -- and friends.


 Jane 
Well, that's kind of where- we're in between which family we're going
to see and when and how and get all that worked out.


 Ed 
Uh,


 Jane 


 Ed 
so whoev- yeah, I've seen them- -- just not the gifts it comes down to
the food. See, now you (()).


 Jane 
There you go.  I- one of these choices is meat cooking. We'll have to
put that towards the end.


 Ed 
((Ah, oui.)) -- Eh, ((nice)).  So we- we've only-


 Jane 


 Ed 
my family's, uh,  parents are deceased and most of ((them)) is, uh,
passed my brothers all over, so her family's still younger -- and, uh,
you know, just the odd sides. She's the oldest and I'm the youngest,
so she's got younger which -- keeps the thing going, so I- -- you know, my
view is -- ((stay)) with the family go visit the family. That's all you
got.  So -- keep it together through thick and thin and -- when it comes
to Thanksgiving we go up there and we celebrate.  And then there's
little parties.  Big- uh, her sister does a big family party -- but try
to keep that same


 Jane 


 Ed 
local family coming together.  It's amazing how they can get into
little squabbles and who doesn't show up


 Jane 
Of course.


 Ed 
like that. I think it's crazy.  So, ((so, uh))-


 Jane 
They used to always really all get together. but his parents uh they
actually live next door to us. but they're starting to get up in the
years, so they're not,  you know, hosting the big parties, so it's
funny how now people don't all bother to come


 Ed 
Yeah.


 Jane 
and you kind of wonder you know in the next couple of years what's all
going to happen. Are they all going to see each other.


 Ed 
Yeah, no that's- that's exactly. I've already seen,  you know, ((in))
my parents ((' bed)) until they ((got)) less and less that the
brothers got together -- and then now when there's an event you try to
do it.  At Christmas it's just impossible because we leave -- two days
after Christmas


 Jane 
Mhm.


 Ed 
to go out of the country as part of our New Year's


 Jane 


 Ed 
celebration. So, for us it's, you know, got to be a quick trip up


 Jane 


 Ed 
to her family and then back where we- -- we've been invited to be down
in


 Jane 


 Ed 
another country. If a person is not- even though it's cold up in the
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" mod="NE" type="RGN">Northeast</PLACE>, it's a family tradition. I should do it -- and less for the
gifts and more for


 Jane 


 Ed 
being together.  Yeah.


 Jane 
Well, we did- -- -for the kids you know we made it pretty cl-


 Ed 
I don't know, I think that's great.


 Jane 
-you know, you didn't have all the hassle of running around and being
crazy and just kind of spent time together


 Ed 
And I think that's very- I mean, if-


 Jane 
and it was really pretty nice.


 Ed 
Yeah, we haven't- -- yeah, I think -- e- e- eventually that may happen,
the way we're going with, uh,


 Jane 


 Ed 
my wife and I with her


 Jane 


 Ed 
family. Not as a negative but as a-


 Jane 


 Ed 
you know, we do a lot of traveling so that's going to be- I think
that's going to come up.


 Jane 


 Ed 
But- -- but for now we're still trying to do-


 Jane 


 Ed 
as long as the mother's around,  we'll still do Christmas and act as-


 Jane 


 Ed 
she is not really old, but she's getting older, so I think that's one
reason to stay together


 Jane 


 Ed 
and also I think i- is


 Jane 


 Ed 
eh, we- we kind of -- infused a little family party that her sister has
so -- I think if we were to go away both of those might fall off a
little bit and it doesn't take but one year and then all of the sudden
everybody's


 Jane 
Yeah.


 Ed 
not coming to it anymore and it's like a-


 Jane 
That's it. That's the way it is.


 Ed 
Yeah, but not because-


 Jane 
If I'm no-


 Ed 
it is- -- I- I enjoy the -- smiling people and the festive- -- festive
nature and -- I think it does get a little commercialized. ((It's not
that the-)) -- You can ignore that part of it, I guess.
