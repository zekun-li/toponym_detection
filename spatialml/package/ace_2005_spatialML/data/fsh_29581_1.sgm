10. Death of Arafat (2) PLO leader PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a
<PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18543072" id="Pl-5" latLong="48.867°N 2.333°E" predicative="true" state="FR-75" type="PPLC">Paris</PLACE> <PLACE country="FR" form="NOM" id="Pl-58" state="FR-75" type="FAC">hospital</PLACE> last week, after a lot of controversy surrounding his
illness and death.  What do you think caused his illness, and could it
have been something malicious (like poisoning)?  What do you think of
<PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-1" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE>'s policies surrounding Arafat's illness and death?  Should
President Bush or a senior <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> official have attended Arafat's funeral?
Should <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-2" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> have let Arafat be buried in <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19202908" id="Pl-10" latLong="31.767°N 35.233°E" state="IL-JM" type="PPL">Jerusalem</PLACE>?


 Ed 
Hello, this is Ed.


 James 
Uh,  Hi, yeah, this is James.


 Ed 
Hey, James.


 James 
How you doing?


 Ed 
Good.


 James 
Well,  what do you think?


 Ed 
I think I was on this one yesterday, same subject.


 James 
I, I believe I've talked about this subject once before too.


 Ed 
Uh,  Well, let's see, my past views were, uh -- illness-wise, ah -- I
don't think -- it helped him, being in the <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-55" type="FAC">compound</PLACE>.


 James 
Right.  Right.


 Ed 
But,  You're, you know, you're never going to know if there was any,
ah, clandestine-type operation that -- Aided his, ah -- ah,  illness.


 James 
Mhm.


 Ed 
I think that they, ah,  (( )), I don't think you're ever going to find
out if there was any direct


 James 
Right.


 Ed 
tampering


 James 
Right.


 Ed 
but I don't, you know, from just the generic point, or general point
of view, it didn't help his illness once he got -- sick -- being in the
<PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-56" type="FAC">compound</PLACE>, closed in like that with the Arabs.


 James 
Right.  Right.


 Ed 
And that


 James 
I don't -- I don't know if I think there was something -- you know,
malicious done, because, you know, looking back -- he's been had this
shaking thing going on


 Ed 
Yeah.


 James 
for quite some time.  And I agree that the surroundings couldn't have
helped.


 Ed 
Right.


 James 
Yeah, it, it could've only exacerbated, uh,  his situation.  Because
for -- for a good little while now I've noticed, you know, that his lips
would tremble, and


 Ed 
Yeah.


 James 
and, you know, it's like, um,  uh, almost like he had, uh, what is
that, Parkinson's?


 Ed 
Yeah.


 James 
Uh, something like that, but, uh, I don't know what the exact
conditions were -- in that <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-57" type="FAC">compound</PLACE>, but they couldn't have been
couldn't have been, ah, conducive to someone of his age -- and of his
health -- and as far as, as, ah, the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> sending a senior ~<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-7" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>
official, I think they should've sent someone -- I don't know how senior
that person had to be.  But, uh,  it could've been a gesture


 Ed 
Well they did -- they did send somebody, I thought. Didn't they go
with a senior official, I had


 James 
to


 Ed 
didn't think they were going to ask this question, but I


 James 
Oh y- yeah, you're right, they did send someone.


 Ed 
but it wasn't -- like, ah, wasn't Bush, I definitely wouldn't send him,
I don't think you want to have him in that part of the world right
now.


 James 
Right.  No.  No.  No, I don't think


 Ed 
Regardless of what you think about him, he's, ah


 James 
Yeah, I don't think he should have went -- as a matter of fact, I don't
think any senior official should've went, I don't think -- Secretary of
State Colin Powell should have went.  Uh, whoever they sent was, was
good enough.


 Ed 
Yeah.


 James 
Yeah, was good enough, just to show -- the <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-11" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Palestinian</PLACE> people -- that, uh
you know, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" type="COUNTRY">America</PLACE> does care somewhat -- that you've lost your leader.
But, uh, no,  it would've been -- it would've been a wro- as a matter of
fact, I think sending Bush would have made it worse.  You know.  Uh,
because he's not liked that much by the <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-12" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Palestinian</PLACE> people.  So I, I
don't think sending him would've been -- would've been the right thing
to do.


 Ed 
No, I agree with that.


 James 
Yeah, I don't think it would've added anything to -- to the situation.
and possibly could've made it worse.


 Ed 
Yeah.


 James 
Yeah.


 Ed 
As to -- his burial


 James 
Mhm.


 Ed 
ah,  Not anymore, these are all, uh like these are all political
responses


 James 
Huh.  Right.


 Ed 
you know, there is no right answer, considering that that is not


 James 
Mhm.


 Ed 
you know, they're still arguing over -- that land, and is it, ah


 James 
Yeah.


 Ed 
who owns it and respect, so I mean it's


 James 
Mhm.  I'd say my overall opinion is that -- this conflict is way past
that time.


 Ed 
Yeah, well,


 James 
You know, it's been going on for all these many -- what,


 Ed 
Hundreds.


 James 
hundreds of years -- and a lot of people have lost their lives, and and
a lot of kids have grown up and all they've ever known -- on both sides
<PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-3" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Israeli</PLACE> and <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-13" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Palestinian</PLACE>, all they've ever known is war.  And it's just
tiresome.  I mean, that's, that's my, my view, this thing has gone so
long -- like you said, about a piece of land.  And it's just, you know,
They, they, they got to learn at some point -- that they're going to
have to be able to get along.  Or this is just going to keep going
around, and around, and around,  and, you know, the the -- the
Palestinians will, will, will -- will -- will do something, then <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-4" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE>
will respond, and then back and forth -- and it's just like a never
ending circle.


 Ed 
Oh yeah.


 James 
It's like a never ending circle of violence and death and destruction.
And, like I said, I'm personally just tired of it.  I think the world
is just tired of it.


 Ed 
Oh yeah.


 James 
You know.  And they need to try and, try and, I, I mean, I don't have
the answer.  You know, I don't have all the answers.  I just know that
it is just -- just an ongoing situation that is- there seems to be -- no
end in sight.


 Ed 
I agree.
