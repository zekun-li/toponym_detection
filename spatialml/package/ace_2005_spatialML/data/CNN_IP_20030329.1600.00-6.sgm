 WOODRUFF 
That report filed just a short time ago. Well, CNN analyst Ken Pollack
who is with the Center for <PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208667208" id="Pl-4" predicative="true" type="RGN">Middle East</PLACE> Policy at the Brookings
Institution is with me now. He is an expert on the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> military and its
tactics and weapons. Ken Pollack, that resistance that we just saw the
<PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-29" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> troops dealing with, you and I were talking earlier today. The
story the last few days has been the surprising level of resistance but
you're telling me your sense is that the coalition forces are beginning
to adjust to that.


 KEN POLLACK, CENTER FOR <PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208667208" id="Pl-5" predicative="true" type="RGN">MIDDLE EAST</PLACE> POLICY, BROOKINGS INSTITUTION 
Right. I mean we're seeing one of the great advantages of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-14" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> and
<PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-25" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> forces now, Judy, which is that they're superbly trained troops.
They have training in a whole variety of different missions and they're
adapting. They recognize now they went in with some false assumptions
about the kind of reception that they were going to face. The plan that
was implemented had some inherent risks in it, risks to the supply line,
risks in terms of not clearing cities and they're shifting. They're
changing and the troops are trained well enough to be able to deal with
that. You've seen <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-16" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> Central Command bringing up additional forces like
the 82nd Airborne Division to better deal with these long supply lines,
get control over the cities and so I think that <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-17" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> and <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-26" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> forces
are beginning to stabilize the battlefield.


 WOODRUFF 
So as an onlooker, as somebody who's studied the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-7" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> capabilities, is
it your sense that the coalition can continue to adjust to whatever they
deal with?


 POLLACK 
Absolutely. One of the things I think we're likely to see is that the
Iraqis are going to have a tougher time adapting than <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-18" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> forces are.
Typically what you've seen in the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-8" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> armed forces is the change has to
come from the top. It doesn't come from the ground up. You don't have
ground commanders calling back and saying hey, we'd like to try this
tactic or this seems to work. Tell everybody else to do the same thing.
Instead the high command has to identify a problem, come up with a
solution and transmit it down. Chances are the Iraqis are going to
continue to stick with what we've seen before, irregular forces blending
in with civilians trying to attack <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-19" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> forces, some more of these
suicide attacks which are going to be problematic for our troops. There's
no way around that but <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-20" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> forces, <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-27" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> forces are beginning to adapt
to it.


 WOODRUFF 
I want to ask you about you mentioned coalition forces going in expecting
more support from ordinary <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-9" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> people. I just interviewed a gentleman,
native of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-10" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, who talks to his family there all the time and he says
they live in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> 20, 30, 50 of them and he said they do the view the
Americans as invaders. They hate Saddam Hussein. They don't like what
he's doing but they don't think the Americans are the answer.


 POLLACK 
All right. Well, this is something that we've been trying to get a grip
on for years, exactly what the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-11" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> people feel and also that I think
the best evidence that we had before the attack began was that Iraqis do,
they despise. They are desperate to be rid of him but by the same token,
they don't like another country coming into their <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-30" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> to overturn the
government and beyond that, I think it's probably most important for most
Iraqis is they're deeply suspicious of the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-31" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE>. They remember
that the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-32" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> betrayed them in 1991. The <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-21" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> didn't finish
Saddam then. President Bush - then President Bush called on them to rise
up and then the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-22" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> did nothing and so they're deeply suspicious of what
we have in mind.


 WOODRUFF 
Which raises questions going forward. One last thing, Ken Pollack I want
to ask about this <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-28" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> officials saying that they have information
that Saddam Hussein has fired his air defense chief. What's the
significance of that?


 POLLACK 
Well, if it's true and obviously we don't know just yet but if it's true,
it is very significant because it's effectively the Iraqis admitting that
many of the civilian casualties that we've seen over the last few days
may in fact have been caused by <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-12" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> surface to air missiles falling
back to ground in residential areas.


 WOODRUFF 
(INAUDIBLE)


 POLLACK 
Exactly, in that <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-75" type="FAC">market</PLACE> and I think it was pretty apparent when you
looked at the video of that <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-76" type="FAC">market</PLACE>, if that had been a <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-23" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> bomb or a
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-24" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> cruise missile, that <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-77" type="FAC">market</PLACE> would have been obliterated. Chances are
it was an <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> surface to air missile.
