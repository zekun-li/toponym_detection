meanwhile, as war is fought a world away, federal, state and local
authorities face their own battle keeping americans safe at home.
president bush said yesterday the threat of domestic terrorism remains
high.


the dying regime if <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">iraq</PLACE> may try to bring terror to our shore shores.
