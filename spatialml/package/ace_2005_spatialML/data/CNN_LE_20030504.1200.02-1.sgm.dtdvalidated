President Bush aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln on Thursday, formally
declaring the successful accomplishment of the military mission in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>.
Welcome back to LATE EDITION. Joining us now are two key members of the
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-7" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In his home state of

here in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-10" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="US-DC" type="PPL">Washington</PLACE>, Democratic Senator Christopher Dodd of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780780" id="Pl-11" latLong="41.667°N 72.667°W" state="US-CT" type="CIVIL">Connecticut</PLACE>.
Senators, welcome back to LATE EDITION. Mr. Chairman, let me begin with
you. Are you among those who are beginning to conclude that, when all the
dust settles, the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-12" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> may not find weapons of mass destruction in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-3" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>?


 SEN. RICHARD LUGAR (R), <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:449508" id="Pl-16" latLong="40.000°N 86.250°W" state="US-IN" type="CIVIL">INDIANA</PLACE> 
No, I concur with Secretary Powell, Secretary Rumsfeld, the president,
that weapons of mass destruction are there, and likewise, that we will be
led to them by people knowledgeable in the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-17" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> as to where they are.
What form we may find them and what traces of destruction and all the
rest of it will be very interesting and, likewise, the intellectual
capital that is there to produce more. Because not much else is -- you
don't need much to get it going again. And that, I think, we have to be
working with these people who are in the business to make sure they don't
re-enter the business, much as we did with <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-18" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Russian</PLACE> scientists under the
Nunn-Lugar program.


 BLITZER 
What about you, Senator Dodd, do you believe, in the end, they will find
weapons of mass destruction?


 SEN. CHRISTOPHER DODD (D), <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780780" id="Pl-19" latLong="41.667°N 72.667°W" state="US-CT" type="CIVIL">CONNECTICUT</PLACE> 
I have no evidence to the contrary. And certainly, they have used them in
the past. There's no doubt about that at all, both in <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-20" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iran</PLACE> and against
the <PLACE form="NAM" id="Pl-21" predicative="true">Kurdish</PLACE> population. So, whether or not they find them in the exact
form that many would assume they would be the case -- possibly some got
out of the country. It wouldn't surprise me to hear that. But I'm going
to work on the assumption, based on the intelligence that has been
gathered, that the weapons of mass destruction existed.


 BLITZER 
What if they don't?


 DODD 
Well, you know, they've used it in the past, and I think the point that
Senator Lugar just made -- certainly having the intellectual capacity to
do this was proven already by the fact they've used them in the past. So,
I wouldn't dwell on that point specifically, because Saddam Hussein
clearly was a producer and a user of biological and chemical weapons. He
clearly was on the track to acquire a nuclear capacity, and the world is
a safer place today because he's not ruling <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>.


 BLITZER 
Will the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-13" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> lose creditability, Mr. Chairman, if, if the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-14" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> finds no
hard evidence, no so-called smoking gun?


 LUGAR 
No, we have full credibility in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>. We've prosecuted with the alliance
a successful liberation of the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> people, and we have clearly caused
Saddam to destroy weapons of mass destruction, or at least to suppress
evidence of them. That is a victory of sorts.This is a facet that's
important. It's important in the war against terrorism that we rout out
whatever is there and, likewise, the people involved, because they might
help supply al Qaeda or other terrorists along the trail.


 BLITZER 
Senator Dodd, how important is it for the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-15" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> to conclusively learn what
happened to Saddam Hussein?


 DODD 
Well, it's important. But I don't think it's as important as finding
Osama bin Laden, for the simple reason that I don't think Saddam Hussein
today poses any threat, wherever he is. If he is alive, obviously, he
doesn't pose the kind of threat that an Osama bin Laden does with his
cellular network around the world to reactivate al Qaeda and
international terrorism. So, it would certainly be good to know where he
is. It would be, certainly, to know, to apprehend him, to bring him
before a court of justice. But I don't think it's absolutely critical for
the ultimate success of this mission that we apprehend him or find out
what happened to him.


 BLITZER 
And you agree with that assessment, Mr. Chairman?


 LUGAR 
Yes, I think that Senator Dodd is right on.
