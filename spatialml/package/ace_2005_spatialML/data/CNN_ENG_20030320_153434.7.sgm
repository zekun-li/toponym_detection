back to something kelly wallace said. she was talking about the
somewhat blase attitude of israelis. we were lacking at the front page
of the <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19202908" id="Pl-1" latLong="31.767°N 35.233°E" state="JM" type="PPLC">jerusalem</PLACE> post the other day. the big banner headline that day
big and bold, was president bush issues ultimatum. on the side column,
as an afterthought, sit tense told to carry gas masks wherever they
go. it gives you a sense of, perhaps what 50 years of tension and war
will do to your mentality. but it does also say that the israelis are
a bit more blase, if that's a fair word for it, than perhaps we are.
president bush, when he talked earlier to reporters, mentioned that
this effort is an effort, this war is an effort to make the homeland,
our homeland, more secure. john king, that whole issue of homeland
security must be so much on the minds of so many government officials,
given the level of the terror alert today.


reporter: so far, so good is the assessment we're getting from senior
administration officials as they try to track what they worry about
most. as we have the strikes overseas throughout <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">iraq</PLACE>, there will be
retaliatory terror strikes, either by organized terrorist networks or
sympathetic terrorists or people against the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-11" type="COUNTRY">united states</PLACE> in this
<PLACE country="KW" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:19210228" id="Pl-5" latLong="29.500°N 47.750°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>. so far, so good. no plans, we're told, to raise the threat
level, though it's already at orange, which is high. so microsoft of
the president's business has been behind the scenes today. he's the
most senior of about a handful of senior administration officials,
including the vice president and the secretary of state. the <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-12" type="COUNTRY">national</PLACE>
security advisor fanning out, we're told in phone calls to more than
three dozen world leaders offering them an update on what is going on.
but we did here hear from the president a bit earlier today. we see
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">baghdad</PLACE>, a <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-14" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">capitol</PLACE> under siege. mr. bush in the cabinet room at the
white house to portray a different image, trying to show in
<PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-15" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="DC" type="PPLC">washington</PLACE>, it's business as usual, urgent business as, but still
business as usual with secretary of defense rumsfeld on one side,
secretary of state powell on the other. the president offered a brief
statement in the cabinet room.

reporter: so even at the very early stages of a defining moment of
bush presidency, the president trying to make the case his eyes and
especially the eyes of his cabinet still on the domestic affairs of
the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" type="COUNTRY">united states</PLACE> as the early prosecution of the war continues. one
thing the president said that will be the point of contention around
the world, the president called it an ever-growing coalition of 40
countries. that is handful more nations that were actively involved in
the coalition his father assembled 12 years ago for the <PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18493586" id="Pl-17" latLong="27.000°N 51.000°E" type="WATER">persian gulf</PLACE>
war, but there is a significant difference, of course. in this
coalition, it ips the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-10" type="COUNTRY">united states</PLACE> doing the overwhelming load of the
fighting. <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-18" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">british</PLACE> forces on the ground, <PLACE country="AU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18443435" id="Pl-19" latLong="25.000°S 135.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">australian</PLACE> troops scheduled to
take part, perhaps in some way. in the last <PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18493586" id="Pl-20" latLong="27.000°N 51.000°E" type="WATER">gulf</PLACE> war, you had arab
forces on the ground. the egyptians, syrians, saudis, qataris taking
up arms to expel the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-3" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">iraqi</PLACE> armiy <PLACE country="KW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19210228" id="Pl-4" latLong="29.500°N 47.750°E" type="COUNTRY">kuwait</PLACE>. no such participation this
time around. abc the president says, this is a growing coalition, this
is one of the big geo political debates going on around the world as
the president
