Omar over at <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-1" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> The Model posted a few thought on the rally today
in <PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-14" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Syria</PLACE>:

I have noticed that some media sources are focusing on the size of
the demonstrations and the number of the people who were gathered to
attend at that time and place. I think that the number of participants
doesn't make a demonstration strong at all.

The BBC says : The crowd dwarfed previous opposition protests urging
<PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-15" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Syrian</PLACE> troops to leave.

I think that the opposite is true as it proves how the tyrants in
<PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-16" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Syria</PLACE> and their allies in <PLACE country="LB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19193726" id="Pl-19" latLong="33.833°N 35.833°E" type="COUNTRY">Lebanon</PLACE> are so scared of the growing sense of
liberty among the people in <PLACE country="LB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19193726" id="Pl-20" latLong="33.833°N 35.833°E" type="COUNTRY">Lebanon</PLACE>.

The reason why I adopt this opinion is very simple; the opposition
rallies were calling for liberty to their <PLACE country="LB" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:19193726" id="Pl-3" latLong="33.833°N 35.833°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> and rejecting the
<PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-5" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Syrian</PLACE> interference which has infiltrated all important life sectors in
<PLACE country="LB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19193726" id="Pl-17" latLong="33.833°N 35.833°E" type="COUNTRY">Lebanon</PLACE> in the last 15 years.

While Hizbollah's rallies are allegedly opposing the &quot;<PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208561573" id="Pl-22" predicative="true" type="RGN">western</PLACE> foreign
interference&quot; which in fact doesn't exist!

Moreover, these rallies are actually encouraging the <PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-6" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Syrian</PLACE>
interference (that's foreign interference, right?) in the interior
affairs of <PLACE country="LB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19193726" id="Pl-18" latLong="33.833°N 35.833°E" type="COUNTRY">Lebanon</PLACE> and condemning the decision of international
community represented by resolution 1559.

I see no patriotism at all in holding pictures of another <PLACE country="SY" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-8" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>'s
president (err... I mean tyrant) and chanting &quot;Long live Asad... Long live
<PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-7" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Syria</PLACE>&quot; when that very administration you're cheering and chanting for
has been keeping your <PLACE country="LB" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:19193726" id="Pl-21" latLong="33.833°N 35.833°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> a hostage for over a decade.

Another point is that bringing too many people by buses doesn't mean
that you're right. Actually it reminds me of demonstrations in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>
under the Ba'athist regime (Oops, I forgot that the Ba'athists still
rule in <PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-9" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Syria</PLACE>!)

At least one opposition leader said the pro-<PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-10" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Syrian</PLACE> government
pressured people to turn out Tuesday and some reports said <PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-11" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Syria</PLACE> bused
in people from across the <PLACE form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-23" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" mod="BORDER" type="COUNTRY">border</PLACE>. The MSNBC reports .

Very good points.

We all know that Hezbollah is financed and supported by <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-24" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Iran</PLACE>. <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-25" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Iran</PLACE>
and <PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-12" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Syria</PLACE> are best pals so in goes Hezbollah to truck in some pro-<PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-13" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Syrian</PLACE>
&quot;supporters&quot;

Ammar over at Across The Bay makes even better points:

Tomorrow, and on the eve of the &quot;glorious&quot; event that brought the
Baath Party to power in 1963, more such recruits will gather in <PLACE continent="AI" country="SY" form="NAM" id="P-27" latLong="33.501944, 36.253889" state="SY-DI" type="FAC">al-Jalaa
Stadium</PLACE> to perform another sycophant song and dance about national honor
and pride (a similar demonstration organized by Hizbollah will take
place in <PLACE country="LB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19198454" id="Pl-26" latLong="33.872°N 35.510°E" state="BA" type="PPLC">Beirut</PLACE>). But the truth is, and the people know it, Baath rule
brought nothing but shame and humiliation. It destroyed the very moral
and civil fabric of our fledgling republic.

And the people know it. And the people know it. That's exactly the
problem. The people know it. This is not the time of ignorance anymore.
We know. We are informed. We may not the whole truth about what is
happening all around in us, but we really don't need to. We just know
enough not to be fooled by empty promises and gestures. We know enough
to distinguish between victory and defeat, between a show of principles
and a freak show. Even more weirder. Check out the below picture of the
demonstration today:
