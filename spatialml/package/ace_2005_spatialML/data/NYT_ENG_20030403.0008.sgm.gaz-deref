gathered its most-trusted forces or wait and see if the war can be
won without paying the price of street-to-street urban fighting.

``We are expectingn or at least planning for, a very difficult fight
ahead,'' Gen. Stanley McChrystal said at the Pentagon Tuesday. ``We
are not expecting to drive into <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-16" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> suddenly and seize it.''

Instead of an all-out assault, analysts expect the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> to
follow the example of <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-2610495 IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-36" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> forces outside the southern <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-26" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-56" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE>

If these patrols meet little opposition, thousands of troops could
rush into the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-38" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE>. If the Iraqis respond forcefully, the Army and

Division, which will soon start moving north from <PLACE country="KW" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-789772 IGDB:19210228" id="Pl-39" latLong="29.500°N 47.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Kuwait</PLACE>. While they
wait, the forces would try to determine where <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-28" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> strong points are

``The <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897821 NGA:-3102179" id="Pl-41" latLong="30.494°N 47.819°E" predicative="true" state="BA" type="PPL">Basra</PLACE> model will work for a while, at least until you see

Lawrence Korb, an analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations who was
assistant defense secretary under former President Ronald Reagan.

``Before going in (with a full assault), you have to decide if it's
worth the risks, and ... you have to know who's there in the way of

said.

The administration has said it wants to minimize casualties to <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-30" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE>

instructive, the analysts said. The <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-2610495 IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-46" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> have been outside the

``The key endgame may be whether the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> can parse out the key
regime centers of power in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-17" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> and attack them without having to
fight into the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-51" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE>, or at least locate them well enough to atman of
the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in his daily
war report.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> strategists say that Hussein, if he is still alive and in
control of his forces, might like a bloody battle in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-18" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> because
such fighting could cause heavy <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> casualties. His last hope for
survival might be that the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> loses its taste for such
losses and forces President Bush to negotiate a compromise that would
allow Hussein and his family to keep power in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-19" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>.

But Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:531871 IGDB:532871" id="Pl-52" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="DC" type="PPL">Washington</PLACE> said
the apparent collapse of Republican Guard resistance could deprive
Hussein of much of the wallop he was counting on in the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-57" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE>.

``If <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> forces seriously degrade <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-31" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>'s half-dozen Republican Guard
divisions before that final battle, and only have to face perhaps
30,000 Special Republican Guard, fedayeen, and related personnel, the
task will not be as hard as it might have been,'' he said.

While two guard divisions have apparently been smashed, there are
three others in the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-20" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" predicative="true" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> area. A sixth remains in northern <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-32" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="N" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>.

Cordesman said it seems the guards have been reinforced by units from
the regular <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-33" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> army, which is generally viewed as less reliable.
This shows the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-34" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> military's growing weakness, he said.

``The Republican Guard has taken a massive hammering at every level
and is now scattered and deploying somewhat erratically at the
brigade level,'' he said.

The Iraqis still haven't used chemical weapons, even though many
experts feared such attacks as the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-7" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> troops neared <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-21" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>. Korb,
who's convinced Hussein has stocks of chemical weapons he never
reported to U.N. inspectors, said he wouldn't be surprised if Hussein
tried to use them.

But he also said, ``He may destroy them to embarrass us,'' to show
the world he never had such weapons and that Bush invaded for no
reason other than aggression.

The <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> forces zeroing in on <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-22" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> _ the 1st Marine Division from
the east and the Army's 3rd Mechanized Infantry Division _ are
trained in urban warfare. But in such close-quarters fighting, they
would lose much of the technological advantage of their air
supremacy, which would have to be curtailed because bombing in a <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-58" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE>
can cause large civilian casualties.

However, <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-23" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> from the air looks like <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1663328 USGS:1662328" id="Pl-53" latLong="34.052°N 118.243°W" state="CA" type="PPL">Los Angeles</PLACE> _ wide, straight
boulevards intersected by side streets in a grid pattern. ``Our
forces would be capable of dealing with it reasonably. But there
would be lots of casualties on all sides,'' Korb said.
