From the Associated Press : <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="USGS:277593 IGDB:278593" id="Pl-4" latLong="37.775°N 122.418°W" state="CA" type="PPL">City</PLACE> residents will vote next year on a
proposed weapons ban that would deny handguns to everyone except law
enforcement officers, members of the military and security guards.

If passed next November, residents would have 90 days to give up
firearms they keep in their homes or businesses. The proposal was
immediately dismissed as illegal by a gun owners group.

Firearms would be allowed only for police officers, security guards,
members of the military, and anyone else &quot;actually employed and engaged
in protecting and preserving property or life within the scope of his or
her employment,&quot; according to the measure.

Gun Owners of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778 USGS:1779778" id="Pl-5" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="CA" type="CIVIL">California</PLACE>, a <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1660564 USGS:1659564" id="Pl-6" latLong="38.582°N 121.493°W" state="CA" type="PPLA">Sacramento</PLACE>-based lobbying group, quickly
called the ban illegal. Sam Paredes, the group's executive director,
said <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:1780778 USGS:1779778" id="Pl-7" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="CA" type="CIVIL">state</PLACE> law bars local governments from usurping the <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:1780778 USGS:1779778" id="Pl-8" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="CA" type="CIVIL">state</PLACE>'s
authority to regulate firearms.

&quot;The amazing thing is they are going to turn <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:277593 IGDB:278593" id="Pl-2" latLong="37.775°N 122.418°W" state="CA" type="PPL">San Francisco</PLACE> into
ground zero for every criminal who wants to profit at their chosen
profession,&quot; Paredes said.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:531871 IGDB:532871" id="Pl-10" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="DC" type="PPLC">Washington</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1702382 IGDB:1703382" id="Pl-15" latLong="38.917°N 77.001°W" state="DC" type="CIVIL">D.C.</PLACE>, is the only major <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="USGS:531871 IGDB:532871" id="Pl-11" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="DC" type="PPLC">city</PLACE> that currently bans
handgun possession by private citizens. Andrew Arulanandam, director of
public affairs for the National Rifle Association, said <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:277593 IGDB:278593" id="Pl-3" latLong="37.775°N 122.418°W" state="CA" type="PPL">San Francisco</PLACE>
would be remiss to use that <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="USGS:531871 IGDB:532871" id="Pl-18" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="DC" type="PPLC">city</PLACE> as a model.

&quot;If gun control worked, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:531871 IGDB:532871" id="Pl-12" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="DC" type="PPLC">Washington</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1702382 IGDB:1703382" id="Pl-16" latLong="38.917°N 77.001°W" state="DC" type="CIVIL">D.C.</PLACE>, would be the beacon.
However, it's the murder capital of the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-14" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE>,&quot; he said.

If approved, the weapons ban would take effect in January 2006. Quote
of the day: &quot;Firearms would be allowed only for police officers,
security guards, members of the military, and anyone else actually
employed and engaged in protecting and preserving property or life
within the scope of his or her employment.&quot;

So preserving property or life within the scope of self-defense and
protection of the home is not allowed. No thanks. If the people vote for
this measure it will be hard to sympathize with them when robbery and
rape rates skyrocket, because burgulars will know homes are not guarded,
and rapists will know the only thing stopping them from the victim they
desire is their own inhibitions.
