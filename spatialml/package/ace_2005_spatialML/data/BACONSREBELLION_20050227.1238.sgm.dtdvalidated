Where is Investigative Journalism?

Governor Mark Warner has turned state government upside-down in an
effort to do more business with small, women, and minority owned (SWAM)
firms and the thanks he gets are headlines like this one in the Daily
Press : Warner's plan to raise contracting diversity falls short .

The article is full of innuendo that procurement officals are
ignoring the Governor's wishes and just waiting for him to leave office,
that &quot;special deals&quot; are cut with non-SWAM vendors, and that somehow the
electronic procurement system is &quot;stacked&quot; against SWAM firms. If true,
these are serious charges, worthy of high-level investigation.

What's missing from the article, though, is any attempt at
investigative journalism to give even one factual example supporting the
innuendo. What's also missing is a fair-minded review of whether the
sagging numbers reported for SWAM procurement are valid.

Someday a journalist is going to take the time to watch a sample
number of SWAM firms submit bids on openly posted contracts, then use
procurement tools that are in place to determine if any SWAM firms were
unfairly denied contracts they deserved. Until then, this carping
appears to be sour grapes. Governor Warner has done plenty to open up
the system to SWAM firms and give them a presumptive advantage, even
inviting a backlash by non-SWAM firms. Maybe SWAM firms aren't doing all
they can to return the Governor's faith in them.

The dominant narrative among the Mainstream Media, even at a local
level, is that the institutions of <PLACE country="US" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> society are, to varying degrees,
racist. Any shortcomings in minority achievement are to be explained as
the result of discrimination of some sort. End of story. What's to
investigate? What need to examine &quot;the other side of the story?&quot;
