Laser Beam Question

This recent news story is troubling in many different ways. When I
first heard of the story I figured it was some wackjob playing with a
new toy but now we find out there have been 7 incidents since Christmas
from the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208918643" id="Pl-1" type="RGN">West</PLACE> to <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208918467" id="Pl-2" type="RGN">East coast</PLACE>. The FBI, concerned that terrorists could
use lasers as weapons, is investigating why laser beams were directed
into the cockpits of seven airplanes in flight since Christmas.

Laser beams can temporarily blind or disorient pilots and possibly
cause a plane to crash.

The FBI is looking into two incidents in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:204797 IGDB:205797" id="Pl-3" latLong="38.834°N 104.821°W" state="CO" type="PPL">Colorado Springs</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780779 USGS:1779779" id="Pl-4" latLong="39.000°N 105.500°W" state="CO" type="CIVIL">Colo.</PLACE>, and
one each in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1067654 USGS:1066654" id="Pl-5" latLong="41.499°N 81.696°W" state="OH" type="PPL">Cleveland</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:531871 IGDB:532871" id="Pl-6" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="DC" type="PPLC">Washington</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1380948 IGDB:1381948" id="Pl-7" latLong="29.763°N 95.363°W" state="TX" type="PPL">Houston</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:881141 IGDB:882141" id="Pl-8" latLong="40.860°N 74.060°W" state="NJ" type="PPL">Teterboro</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779795 IGDB:1780795" id="Pl-9" latLong="40.167°N 74.500°W" state="NJ" type="CIVIL">N.J.</PLACE>, and
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1124040 IGDB:1125040" id="Pl-10" latLong="42.327°N 122.874°W" state="OR" type="PPL">Medford</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1155107 IGDB:1156107" id="Pl-11" latLong="44.000°N 120.500°W" state="OR" type="CIVIL">Ore.</PLACE>, according to federal and local law enforcement and
transportation officials, some of whom spoke only on condition of
anonymity.

A federal law enforcement official, who declined to be identified by
name, said Thursday there is no evidence of a plot or terrorist
activity. But pilots are troubled by the incidents, and the FBI earlier
this month warned of the possibility that terrorists might use the
devices as weapons.

&quot;It's not some kid,&quot; said Paul Rancatore, a pilot who serves as
deputy chairman of the security committee for the Allied Pilots
Association. &quot;It's too organized.&quot;

Loren Thompson, who teaches military technology at <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532663 USGS:531663" id="Pl-12" latLong="38.905°N 77.063°W" state="DC" type="PPL">Georgetown</PLACE>
University, called it a &quot;rather worrisome development,&quot; though he said
experts would be more puzzled than alarmed.

&quot;What we're talking about is a fairly powerful visible light laser
that has the ability to lock onto a fast-moving aircraft,&quot; Thompson
said. &quot;That's not the sort of thing you pick up at a military surplus
store.&quot;

Thompson said a piece of equipment that could do the things the FBI
suspects would be &quot;fairly expensive and fairly sophisticated.&quot;

&quot;It sounds like an organized effort to cause airline accidents,&quot;
Thompson said. Michelle Malkin has a post about this today where some
outlets have stopped selling lasers. Lots of people think that these
indeed might be loonies playing with new Christmas toys but I disagree.

These are incidents where the Airplanes were tracked , some as high
as 8500 feet. To track a fast moving plane at that altitude would not be
some toy you can get from the local wal-mart. In my opinion this is
quite alarming.

This Isn't Writing, It's Typing has a great post out with a ton of
info, some of it quite scary A more frightening scenario is that
terrorists may have obtained a <PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-1900673 IGDB:18099327" id="Pl-13" latLong="35.000°N 105.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Chinese</PLACE>-produced ZM-87 laser blinder

They had planned to use the laser against <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-246227 IGDB:19753773" id="Pl-16" latLong="35.685°N 139.751°E" state="13" type="PPLC">Tokyo</PLACE> policemen, but the plan
failed when the laser malfunctioned during the testing stage.&quot;
PoliticAlex also has some info on this story also.

I found the following report that was presented to Congress recently
about the shoulder launched missle threat to airliners, which this might
very well be a precursor to: Recent events have focused attention on the
threat that terrorists with shoulder fired surface-to-air missiles
(SAMs), referred to as Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS), pose
to commercial airliners. Most believe that no single solution exists to
effectively mitigate this threat. Instead, a menu of options may be
considered, including installing infrared (IR) countermeasures on
aircraft; modifying flight operations and air traffic control
procedures; improving airport and regional security; and strengthening
missile non-proliferation efforts. Equipping aircraft with missile
countermeasure systems can protect the aircraft even when operating in
areas where ground-based security measures are unavailable or infeasible
to implement. However, this option has a relatively high cost, between
$1 million and $3 million per aircraft, and the time needed for
implementation does not allow for immediate response to the existing
terrorist threat. Procedural improvements such as specific flight crew
training, altering air traffic procedures to minimize exposure to the
threat, and improved security near airports may be less costly than
countermeasures and could more immediately help deter domestic terrorist
attacks. However, these techniques by themselves cannot completely
mitigate the risk of domestic attacks and would not protect <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-21" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE>
airliners flying to and from foreign airports.

Legislation introduced in the 108th Congress (H.R. 580, S. 311) calls
for the installation of missile defense systems in all turbojet aircraft
used in scheduled air carrier service. While this legislation is still
under consideration, Homeland Security appropriations designated $60
million in FY2004 and $61 million in FY2005 to fund a program to develop
and test prototype missile countermeasure systems for commercial
aircraft based on existing military technology. It is anticipated that
at the conclusion of this program, in January 2006, the Department of
Homeland Security will be able to provide a detailed analysis of the
suitability of such systems for use to protect commercial passenger
aircraft.
