Why Are Cable News Stations Obsessed With Laci Peterson?; Interview 
With Nicholas Lemann

<TEXT>


 KURTZ 
Welcome back to RELIABLE SOURCES. Nicholas Lemann has worked first for
&quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; and now &quot;The New Yorker,&quot; covering everything from
politics to education to poverty and has written four books in the
process. But now he is taking on a new job at one of the <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" type="COUNTRY">nation</PLACE>'s most
prestigious universities, dean of Columbia's Journalism School. Nick
Lemann joins us now from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-2" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL">New York</PLACE>. Welcome.


 NICHOLAS LEMANN, DEAN, COLUMBIA'S SCHOOL OF JOURNALISM 
Thanks.


 KURTZ 
Let's talk about your new job at Columbia. I'm a
graduate of Columbia Journalism School. You didn't go to journalism
school. Why did you want this job?


 LEMANN 
Well, because the president of the university, who is relatively new, and
the provost of the university, who is brand new, both of whom are
children of journalists, have made it a top priority of theirs to really
pour money and attention into taking the school to the next level. So
it's a very exciting opportunity to, you know, explore the outer limits
of what can be done in journalism education.


 KURTZ 
But you know, you don't need a license or a permit or a degree to
practice journalism. Some would say why do we need j schools at all?


 LEMANN 
The good analogy would be business schools. You know, the question is not
need; the question is, is there value added for the people who go there?
You don't need to have gone to business school, you know, the poster
child for Columbia Business School, of course, is Warren Buffett. He
would say he got his money's worth out of going to Columbia Business
School and I think nobody can argue with that. So one of the great things
about journalism is that you don't have to have gone to journalism
school. I myself started my career at age 17 at an alternative paper, so
I'm a beneficiary of the lack of credentials, but I do think that at a
great university like Columbia, we're the only Ivy League graduate-only
journalism school, you can draw on the extraordinary riches of the
university, of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-3" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL">New York City</PLACE>, of the media industry that's pretty much
headquartered here, and of the faculty and alumni of this school and
really provide something special for the people who go there. So the
question is not do all journalists have to go there? They don't. It is a
voluntary thing, and that's good. It gives us a fair test of value. If
the question is, will -- do and will the people who go to Columbia
Journalism School feel over the long term that they got something useful
out of it, I hope we can answer that with a resounding yes.


 KURTZ 
Let me read you a skeptical column by &quot;Newsweek's&quot; Robert Samuelson. He
says Columbia's president, Lee Bollinger's -- that &quot;Bollinger's haughty
vision seems confirmed by his choice for the dean of the journalism
school, Nicholas Lemann. He is a brilliant writer, an exhaustive
reporter, a gifted thinker, and from everything I know a nice guy.&quot; Not
bad. But, &quot;he has specialized in long, reflective articles to upscale,
that elite publications, with comparatively small circulations. Most
recently &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; and &quot;The New Yorker.&quot; Most reporters do
less exalted work.&quot; Do you plead guilty to being an elitist?


 LEMANN 
No, I don't. I mean, first of all my goal in going to the school is not
to turn everybody into, you know, mini me. Second of all, just on a small
point, I believe &quot;The New Yorker&quot; now has a bigger circulation than &quot;The
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-4" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="DC" type="PPL">Washington</PLACE> Post&quot; so, you know, who is calling who a small circulation
publication? It is smaller than &quot;Newsweek.&quot; Look, the question is, you
know, if you're fortunate enough to be able to get it, as Bob Samuelson
himself was, can education at a great research university help you over
the long term? Yes, it can. We're not making everybody go to journalism
school. We're saying we can provide an educational experience that will
enrich your career as a journalist, particularly by making it possible
for you to have a kind of deeper, richer understanding of the
complexities of the world you'll have to cover.


 KURTZ 
You're starting to sound like an academic. The Jayson Blair scandal
obviously has kind of cast a pall over the news business. All of these
scandals, some of them involving young journalists, going back to Steven
Glass and others, would seem to suggest perhaps that journalism schools
are not doing as great a job as they might at imparting journalistic
ethics. Is that an area that needs more attention?


 LEMANN 
Well, I'm going to give you the same refrain which is all journalists
didn't go to journalism school. Journalism schools aren't in charge of
making sure that in the out years over decades that nobody does anything
dishonest in journalism.


 KURTZ 
Is it something that you would put an emphasis on?


 LEMANN 
It already is a very heavy emphasis at the school and will continue to
be. Knock on wood, none of these cases so far has involved a Columbia
Journalism School grad, and I hope you continue to behave yourself,
Howie, as well.


 KURTZ 
I'll do my best to uphold the traditions. We'll have to leave it there.
Good luck in your new job, Nick Lemann. Thanks for joining us.


 LEMANN 
Thank you.


 KURTZ 
Still to come, why the media keep on obsessing about the Kennedys whether
they're dead or alive.
