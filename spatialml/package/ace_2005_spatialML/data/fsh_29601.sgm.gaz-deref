10. Death of Arafat (2) PLO leader PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a
<PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-1456928 IGDB:18543072" id="Pl-1" latLong="48.867°N 2.333°E" state="75" type="PPLC">Paris</PLACE> <PLACE country="FR" form="NOM" id="Pl-57" state="FR-75" type="FAC">hospital</PLACE> last week, after a lot of controversy surrounding his
illness and death.  What do you think caused his illness, and could it
have been something malicious (like poisoning)?  What do you think of
<PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725 NGA:-780275" id="Pl-2" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE>'s policies surrounding Arafat's illness and death?  Should
President Bush or a senior US official have attended Arafat's funeral?
Should <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725 NGA:-780275" id="Pl-3" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> have let Arafat be buried in <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19202908 NGA:-797092" id="Pl-12" latLong="31.767°N 35.233°E" state="IL-JM" type="PPLC">Jerusalem</PLACE>?


 James 
Hello?


 Joe 
Hello, my name is Joe.


 James 
I'm James from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1618959 USGS:1617959" id="Pl-16" latLong="42.331°N 83.046°W" state="US-MI" type="PPL">Detroit</PLACE>.


 Joe 
Uh, from, uh, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779795 IGDB:1780795" id="Pl-17" latLong="40.167°N 74.500°W" state="US-NJ" type="CIVIL">New Jersey</PLACE>, but I'm living in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:351615 IGDB:352615" id="Pl-18" latLong="33.749°N 84.388°W" state="US-GA" type="PPLA">Atlanta</PLACE> now, going to
college.


 James 
Oh, okay.


 Joe 
All right.


 James 
((I'm sorry.))


 Joe 
So, uh, what do you think about Arafat?


 James 
Well -- I, uh, I don't think there was anything malicious, uh, in terms
of his death -- uh, just looking at him these last, uh, couple of years
uh, it seems like he had Alzheimer's or something.


 Joe 
Yeah, he has been getting older.


 James 
Yeah, because he was quivering at the mouth and and hands were
shaking.  And -- I would imagine that living in that compound couldn't
have been that conducive to his health.


 Joe 
Yeah, he probably should have been in a hospital or a hospice or


 James 
Right.


 Joe 
you know, if it was that bad.


 James 
Right.  Right, I'm sure that they, I don't know about, bout -- the uh
sanitary conditions there, but -- I I just don't think it could have
been, uh, conducive to his health.  And as far as, uh, <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725 NGA:-780275" id="Pl-4" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE>, uh,
allowing -- him to be buried -- uh, in <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19202908 NGA:-797092" id="Pl-13" latLong="31.767°N 35.233°E" state="IL-JM" type="PPLC">Jerusalem</PLACE>


 Joe 
That's accept


 James 
huh?


 Joe 
That's acceptable to me. I mean


 James 
Well, it, it's acceptable to me, but I don't think it was feasible.


 Joe 
feasible


 James 
Yeah, given the circumstance in that area right now.  I don't even
know if they would have been able to pull it off,  you know?


 Joe 
Well, uh, so he, in fact he wasn't


 James 
Pardon me?


 Joe 
so, um -- no, so he wasn't buried in <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19202908 NGA:-797092" id="Pl-14" latLong="31.767°N 35.233°E" state="IL-JM" type="PPLC">Jerusalem</PLACE>.


 James 
No.  No, they buried him -- uh, inside that compound.


 Joe 
Oh, I see.


 James 
Yeah, they buried him inside that <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-51" type="FAC">compound</PLACE>.  But like you say, I
don't, I don't -- I personally -- uh -- wouldn't have seen a problem with
it, but -- I just don't think it was feasible. I don't, I don't think
that they would have been -- uh, secure enough to really do it.  I don't
think either side would have really -- let it happen -- and -- and as far as
a senior <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-19" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> official going, I don't think that would have been
necessary either. Um, I know President Bush shouldn't have went -- and
he wasn't going.


 Joe 
Well, I kind of feel, I kind of feel another way. I think a senior
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-20" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> service in there, should have been there, because I mean -- he,
Arafat's been -- been the one coming to all these peace talks, you know,
with President Clinton and, you know, other


 James 
Mhm.


 Joe 
other um -- litigations towards that.


 James 
Mhm.


 Joe 
You know, I think, I think we could have just showed our face and said
you know, yeah, we do recognize this man.


 James 
Mhm.  Well it, they sent someone.  I don't know who it was -- ((It
wasn't))


 Joe 
It probably, it wasn't anybody important. It was just like a


 James 
Yeah it was an under secretary, there's no doubt about it. There was
no senior


 Joe 


 James 
there was no senior <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-21" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> official there.  There's there's no question
about that.


 Joe 
Yeah.


 James 
But, uh -- you know, uh, Bush's policy -- towards, uh, Yasser Arafat has
been hands off


 Joe 
Yeah.


 James 
from from the beginning cause I don't, I don't think he ever even met
with him. Did he?


 Joe 
I don't think so. I don't think so.


 James 
Yeah, I I


 Joe 
Bush is kind of like, staying away from the whole <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725 NGA:-780275" id="Pl-5" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> -- <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-22" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Palestinian</PLACE>


 James 
Mhm.  Now on his part I think that was a mistake.


 Joe 
Yeah.


 James 
Yeah, you know you got to engage people in some type of dialogue


 Joe 
And


 James 
if you


 Joe 
to me, the talk, the peace talks should have continued -- after
Clinton's administration left.


 James 
True.


 Joe 
Cause at the cause at the end Clinton was doing all this peace talk
with Arafat and, um


 James 
True.  Mhm.


 Joe 
((forget)) the um, prime minister in <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725 NGA:-780275" id="Pl-6" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE>, but he was talking to
him.


 James 
Uh, Sharon.


 Joe 
Sharon, yeah.


 James 
Yeah.  Mhm.


 Joe 
They were doing all these talks in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1711190 IGDB:1712190" id="Pl-23" latLong="39.648°N 77.464°W" state="US-MD" type="RGN">Camp David</PLACE> and and it should have
just continued when Br- Bush came into office.


 James 
You're absolutely right. I agree. Like I said, I think that was one of
Bush's biggest mistakes,


 Joe 
Mhm.


 James 
not continuing -- the talks.  Because Clinton had came so very close


 Joe 
Yes.


 James 
to to maybe getting some type of agreement


 Joe 
No.


 James 
but, uh, Bush just took a hands off approach. He just -- kind of took a
hands off approach.


 Joe 
And now the situation in, you know, <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19202908 NGA:-797092" id="Pl-15" latLong="31.767°N 35.233°E" state="IL-JM" type="PPLC">Jerusalem</PLACE> and the <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208669530" id="Pl-24" state="PS-WE" type="CIVIL">West Bank</PLACE> is
just -- escalated.


 James 
Absolutely.  And I think too -- <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725 NGA:-780275" id="Pl-7" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE>'s -- position toward Arafat -- in
terms of keeping him sort of like -- uh -- surrounded in that <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-53" type="FAC">compound</PLACE> -- I
don't think that was a good idea.


 Joe 
No.


 James 
You know, because that, you can't pick a leader for a people.  Whether
you like them or not -- people get to choose who they want to follow,


 Joe 
Exactly.


 James 
and the Palestinians had made it clear -- that Arafat was their leader.


 Joe 
Exactly.


 James 
So, I think that they, we should have found a way -- <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725 NGA:-780275" id="Pl-8" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> should have
found a way -- to -- keep some type of dialogue -- going along.  Cause uh, I
mean, you look at what's going on now.


 Joe 
Mhm.


 James 
I mean, their policy toward him didn't get them anything.  And then
you got suicide bombing on the one side, and then you got <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725 NGA:-780275" id="Pl-9" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> -- you
know, it's like one day, you'll he- a bomb will go off, the next day
<PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725 NGA:-780275" id="Pl-10" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> will do and air strike and -- you know, it's like going around in
a circle.


 Joe 
Yeah.


 James 
It's like going around in a circle.


 Joe 
It's really a bad situation.


 James 
It is.  It is, and it's, it's been so long -- going on, I mean, you're
talking about something that's been going on historically for hundreds
of years.


 Joe 
Hundreds of years and then, it just recently really come into
spectrum,


 James 
Mhm.


 Joe 
what, nineteen forty nine?


 James 
Mhm.  Mhm.


 Joe 
When um -- the <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725 NGA:-780275" id="Pl-11" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> state -- came into being, or whatever.


 James 
Right.  Right.
