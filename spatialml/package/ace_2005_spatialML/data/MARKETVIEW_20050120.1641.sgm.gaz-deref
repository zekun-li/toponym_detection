Not an ordinary earnings miss?

eBay 's nauseating $19.72 decline (a loss of 19.14%) has that
end-of-an-era feel, like the Motorola crash described in The Money Game
or the nadir of the dot.com collapse profiled in Dot.con . There's news,
of course (the only time there's no news whatsoever is when the entire
market tanks), but missing estimates by a penny and showing some 'red
flags' shouldn't be an excuse for lopping off twice as much as the
market had the night before (after hours, eBay had lost a modest 10% or
so). Watching a stock drop after hours, open lower, and close even lower
than that makes me wonder just who's selling: a runup usually builds on
a gradual crescendo of greater-fool theory -- everyone thinks they can
always sell to someone dumber -- and ends when the greatest fool yet
gets sick of the whole thing and bails.

Well, it's owned heavily by everyone. So the only thing folks can do
is sell. Institutions especially.
