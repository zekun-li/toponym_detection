 Diane 
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1706317" id="Pl-5" latLong="32.750°N 83.500°W" state="US-GA" type="CIVIL">Georgia</PLACE>? Okay.


 Roger 
Mhm.


 Diane 
Oh, tell me about your workplace.


 Roger 
I was going to say, you go first.


 Diane 
Okay, it doesn't matter. You can or I can.


 Roger 
You can go first.


 Diane 
Okay. I own a <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-33" state="US-TX" type="FAC">restaurant</PLACE>.  And uh


 Roger 
Oh those are good.


 Diane 
Yeah. Seventeen people employed there.  Um -- predominantly Hispanics
work in the kitchen area.  They're uh -- well, actually, you know
they're some of my cake decorators in the bakery area too. They're
it's it's predominantly a Hispanic run organization. I'm not Hispanic,
but they uh I've hired uh


 Roger 
Yeah.


 Diane 
a couple that worked out quite well, and then I've let them -- recommend
family members and friends, and that seems to have been a really -- good
setup, because they're -- recommending people that they know work well,
and -- you know, it's it's uh and they're happy with who they're working
with. And I've sort of left some of that up to them. I've got a a
manager that -- you know, she's -- I defer to her on who thinks whether
she thinks I should hire somebody or not. And I've had really good
luck, because the restaurant business typically um


 Roger 
Yeah.


 Diane 
does not keep people very long. It's a short term employment, and I've
got people that's been with me for eight, nine, ten years now.  You
know, long term employees, so


 Roger 
Yeah.


 Diane 
it's -- it's been a good setup.  Um -- you know, I've got the older ones
typically are the ones that run the different departments, you know
the the -- deli area or the bakery area or the up front area, and -- the
new ones kind of defer to them, and -- it sort of runs itself. I feel
really lucky. I've got a I've got a really good crew.


 Roger 
Yeah.


 Diane 
I think I've got a working situation.


 Roger 
Oh, okay.


 Diane 
S- -- Hey, tell me about yours.


 Roger 
So you got -- you at the top, but you got a manager, huh?


 Diane 
Uh uh yeah. I've got a girl that I've hired uh well, I hired her,
let's see, about nine years ago -- It's a Hispanic girl but she speaks
fluent English and Spanish, so she can work with both -- you know
either language problem.


 Roger 
That's what you need.


 Diane 
And she's uh -- hard worker, always there, um -- everybody -- She works
with everybody rather than just telling them what to do, and they
respect her and work for her quite well, so -- I'm not working nearly as
hard as I was a few years back. Tell me about yours now.


 Roger 
Okay, I um,  work at a moving company, Classic Design Services,


 Diane 
Okay.


 Roger

Wachovia for a few years.  and bought our company out from our
previous owner.  um
