<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> Future has a link up to a article written in yesterdays
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1380948 IGDB:1381948" id="Pl-6" latLong="29.763°N 95.363°W" predicative="true" state="US-TX" type="PPL">Houston</PLACE> Chronicle. It describes how the <PLACE form="NAM" gazref="TIPSTER:64878 IGDB:30064878" id="Pl-7" predicative="true" type="CONTINENT">European</PLACE> Governments look to be
changing their tune in regards to President Bush. Why you ask? But there
is arguably more to this sea change than just a grumpy acceptance of the
status quo. From a <PLACE form="NAM" gazref="TIPSTER:64878 IGDB:30064878" id="Pl-8" predicative="true" type="CONTINENT">European</PLACE> perspective, three things are making it
easier to warm to the Bush White House.

One is the death of Yasser Arafat. No issue divides <PLACE form="NAM" gazref="TIPSTER:64878 IGDB:30064878" id="Pl-9" type="CONTINENT">Europe</PLACE> and the
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> more keenly than the <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725 NGA:-780275" id="Pl-15" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Israeli</PLACE>-<PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-18" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Palestinian</PLACE> dispute. For the
last few years, Europeans have criticized Bush for failing to put enough
pressure on <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725 NGA:-780275" id="Pl-16" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> to get out of the occupied territories and for
refusing to deal with Arafat. That another reason why I respect Bush so
much, his refusal to acknowledge that windbag terrorist Arafat. May he
rot in hell. But since Arafat's death, Europeans and Americans have been
able to find common ground: supporting Ariel Sharon's withdrawal from
<PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19202844 NGA:-797156" id="Pl-20" latLong="31.417°N 34.333°E" state="PS-GZ" type="CIVIL">Gaza</PLACE>, putting pressure on <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725 NGA:-780275" id="Pl-17" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> to let the Palestinians hold elections
and, covertly, backing Mahmoud Abbas to become the next <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-19" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Palestinian</PLACE>
leader.

A second reason is <PLACE form="NAM" gazref="TIPSTER:64878 IGDB:30064878" id="Pl-10" type="CONTINENT">Europe</PLACE>'s growing worries about Islamic terrorism.
The murder in November of Theo van Gogh, a provocative <PLACE country="NL" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-2149885 IGDB:17850115" id="Pl-21" latLong="52.500°N 5.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Dutch</PLACE> filmmaker,
at the hands of an Islamic militant has been called <PLACE form="NAM" gazref="TIPSTER:64878 IGDB:30064878" id="Pl-11" type="CONTINENT">Europe</PLACE>'s 9/11.
Though the two events are obviously not fully comparable, it is
certainly true that <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> conservatives, such as Francis Fukuyama and
Bernard Lewis, have found a wider audience recently for the idea that
radical Islam is inimical to <PLACE form="NAM" gazref="TIPSTER:64878 IGDB:30064878" id="Pl-12" predicative="true" type="CONTINENT">European</PLACE> traditions of tolerance. You mean
those radical muslims can be kinda nasty sometimes? Get outta
here....Keep doing business like the cowards in <PLACE country="ES" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-403477 IGDB:19596523" id="Pl-23" latLong="40.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Spain</PLACE> and they will more
then likely have their very own 9/11 to cry about. The third force is
the reappearance, albeit in a milder form, of the threat that kept the
trans-<PLACE form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-1506320 IGDB:18493680" id="Pl-24" latLong="10.000°N 25.000°W" type="WATER">Atlantic</PLACE> alliance together for half a century. The <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-2994055 IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-25" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Russian</PLACE> bear is
growling again. The <PLACE country="UA" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-1057067 IGDB:18942933" id="Pl-26" latLong="49.000°N 32.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Ukrainian</PLACE> election --- complete with its KGB-style
poisoning of the opposition leader and heavy-handed electoral fraud --
has reminded <PLACE form="NAM" gazref="TIPSTER:64878 IGDB:30064878" id="Pl-13" predicative="true" type="CONTINENT">European</PLACE> diplomats of Vladimir V. Putin's determination to
control his &quot;near abroad.&quot; They should be very worried about this item,
I believe Putin is slowly sliding <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-2994055 IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-27" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Russia</PLACE> back to what it once was.
Hopefully our Government isn't asleep at the wheel with this situation
either. There is a personal edge to all this. Just as the snooty
continentals eventually came to admire the gormless <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1660757 IGDB:1661757" id="Pl-28" latLong="34.098°N 118.326°W" predicative="true" state="US-CA" type="PPL">Hollywood</PLACE> actor,
there is a grudging willingness to rethink some prejudices about the
inarticulate <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779801 IGDB:1780801" id="Pl-29" latLong="31.250°N 99.250°W" predicative="true" state="US-TX" type="CIVIL">Texan</PLACE>.

Many <PLACE form="NAM" gazref="TIPSTER:64878 IGDB:30064878" id="Pl-14" predicative="true" type="CONTINENT">European</PLACE> leaders once swallowed the Michael Moore version of
history: that Bush was an ignorant interloper who stole the White House.
His thumping re-election, however, shows that he represents a large body
of conservative <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> opinion.

In short, Europeans are getting used to the idea that it is not Bush
who is the exception, but the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> itself that is exceptional --- and that
if they want to deal with this exceptional superpower they need to humor
it rather than rile it. Strangely enough, this has been Tony Blair's
strategy all along; it is rapidly becoming the <PLACE continent="EU" form="NAM" id="Pl-31" type="CONTINENT">Continent</PLACE>'s strategy,
too. Couldn't of ended that article any better myself. Get used to it
<PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-1427981 IGDB:18572019" id="Pl-30" latLong="46.000°N 2.000°E" type="COUNTRY">France</PLACE>, we ain't going nowhere.
