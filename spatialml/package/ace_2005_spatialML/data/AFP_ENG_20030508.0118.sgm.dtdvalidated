Zaragozano will bring together two complementary businesses, creating
a nationwide distribution platform, trebling the existing Barclays

said in a statement.

&quot;The acquisition of Banco Zaragozano builds on our existing business
creating the sixth largest private sector banking group in <PLACE country="ES" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19596523" id="Pl-7" latLong="40.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Spain</PLACE>&quot; by

of our customers, employees and shareholders.&quot;

The members of the board of Zaragozano have voted in favour of the
transaction and have committed to sell their shares to Barclays.

ordinary share capital of Zaragozano have given irrevocable
commitments to accept the offer.

The takeover, which is subject to approval by 75.01 percent of
Zaragozano shareholders, is expected to be completed in July.
