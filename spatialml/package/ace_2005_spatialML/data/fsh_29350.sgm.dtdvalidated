5. Death of Arafat (1) Controversial PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in
a <PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18543072" id="Pl-5" latLong="48.867°N 2.333°E" predicative="true" state="FR-75" type="PPLC">Paris</PLACE> <PLACE country="FR" form="NOM" id="Pl-48" state="FR-75" type="FAC">hospital</PLACE> last week.  Do you think Arafat's death will help or
hurt the <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-3" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Israeli</PLACE>-<PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-1" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Palestinian</PLACE> peace process?  Was Arafat a good leader?
What do you think <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" predicative="true" state="FR-75" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> policy should be toward <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY">Palestine</PLACE> now that Arafat
has died? What, if anything, should the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-7" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> do to be involved in the
<PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208667208" id="Pl-11" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Middle East</PLACE> peace process?


 Barb 
I'm Barb from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:449508" id="Pl-12" latLong="40.000°N 86.250°W" state="US-IN" type="CIVIL">Indiana</PLACE>.


 Roger 
Okay, I'm Roger from, um,  <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:352615" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.749°N 84.388°W" state="US-GA" type="PPL">Atlanta</PLACE>.


 Barb 
Hi.  So, what do you think about -- Arafat?  Was he a h-


 Roger 
Uh, I think that, um,  I bet he wasn't a really good leader.  I think
that, um,  that his situation -- -- well, see I got to the -- to- to the
level of power that he was in -- back in the eighties -- and once he, um,
you know, started getting wealthy and started getting known,  that
his agenda ch- uh, changed


 Barb 
Mhm.


 Roger 
but it wasn't actually for peace but was to try to find a way to
((send)) the Israelis out of <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19202908" id="Pl-14" latLong="31.767°N 35.233°E" state="IL-JM" type="PPL">Jerusalem</PLACE> in the areas that they wanted.
I really don't think that -- they wanted to coexist. I think that, um,
he wanted -- you know, all his people -- all his people wanted to
coexist with the -- Israelis. I think that, um,  his death -- marks a
beginning of trying to find somebody that -- really wants peace.  I
don't think that in that area of the, um, world that you could
actually have peace. If you know the Bible well you would know that
there's always going to be a conflict there.  Um,  I think that, uh,
the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> should open up -- their -- doors to -- not help, but
support any, um, process for peace in the <PLACE country="IL" form="NOM" id="Pl-17" type="RGN">area</PLACE>, though.  I don't think
that we should get involved to a level, a point where we're sending
people over there and, um, trying to -- help keep the peace or anything
like that,  um.  There's a lot of stuff that can be done -- by just
verbal suppo- -- you know. I think that now he's gone, his family is
still around, and


 Barb 
Yeah.


 Roger 
uh, millions and millions of dollars that he had is still around but
they -- if they bring people in that wasn't involved with his cabinet,
n- um,  have different views than him, somebody that gener- genuinely
can accept the fact that the <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-4" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE>- -- Is- Israelis are there and
they're there to stay -- and, um,  we going to have to find a way to
coexist. If they can find somebody like that, then I think that they
should f- support him and, um,  and back him up -- in trying to help
define -- peace in the area where peace is impossible.  What do you
think about it?


 Barb 
I agree with you. I didn't know that much about it, I wasn't much into
politics back in the eighties.  I was more,  um,  kind of a -- I was a
kid on the run from abusive parents back then so that wasn't a,  you
know, one of my topics of interest at the time, it is now.  Um,  I --
my roommate, and I still don't know that much about -- I'd love to
know more about politics and I'm trying to learn more,  uh, tells me,
you know, he was such a terrible man but, eh, I don't listen to
everything he says.  And I think it -- -- I mean, it would be nice to
have peace over there, but I agree with you, I don't think it's ever
going to happen.  I mean, not the way -- -- not the way they'll -- -- not
like it is here.  And I agree that we shouldn't send people over
there. We've got enough stuff going on with


 Roger 
Yeah.


 Barb 
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-9" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> and I- and, um,  the -- other -- -- the other guy.


 Roger 
Yeah.


 Barb 
We got way too much going and too much expense, I mean, we we can't,
the that's


 Roger 
Yeah.


 Barb 
that would be just putting it over the edge right there.  But I think
ought support, you know, a man that,


 Roger 
Mhm.


 Barb 
like you said, is -- would like to coexist -- with everybody and
somebody that is


 Roger 
Yeah.


 Barb 
peaceful -- and, I don't know, I'd like to learn more about the Bible.
My parents never took me to church or anything.  But, um,


 Roger 
Yeah.


 Barb 
I'd like to -- I know that,  you know, there's been problems, a lot of
conflict over there, and it seems like no matter what,


 Roger 
Ah.


 Barb 
just like <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-10" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> ye- eh, we try to go in and get peace and- and how long
has it been and,  I mean, I think Saddam needed to be removed but
it's- -- there's just -- s- all these people that are going to follow him
no matter what.


 Roger 
Yeah, and, um,  I only know about Yasser Arafat because I, um, study
international affairs a little bit -- and I know -- a very little bit
about him because, of course he was a, um, leader for a long time,
longer than the age that I am -- old, so, but I- I- I- I've noticed -- on
throughout my studies that -- what he represented to the public -- was --
what he represented to the international public -- was not what he was
representing to his people -- and he was representing, um,  peace with
the Israelis and he was representing trying to find ((the whites or))
divide the land so that it would be,  um, stop,  um,  uh, war and
terrorists in the <PLACE country="IL" form="NOM" id="Pl-18" type="RGN">area</PLACE>.  But I don't think that he had the same image
to- to his people. I think that it was a front -- for him to allow to to
be accepted in an international community, but I think -- that his
ultimate plans and goals were to to run the Israelis out -- maybe closer
to the <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19202844" id="Pl-19" latLong="31.417°N 34.333°E" state="PS-GZ" type="CIVIL">Gaza strip</PLACE>, and to re-take <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19202908" id="Pl-15" latLong="31.767°N 35.233°E" state="IL-JM" type="PPL">Jerusalem</PLACE> -- and other cities near
<PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19202908" id="Pl-16" latLong="31.767°N 35.233°E" state="IL-JM" type="PPL">Jerusalem</PLACE>,  and to, uh, uplift his people in a way that -- they could
say, you know, we conquered the Israelis.  It's a matter of, uh -- I
mean, it's more than just land,  it's a, um,  conflict of- -- of,  um,
hatred,  uh, and racism, I mean, eh, different types of people, um,
they don't like each other,


 Barb 
Yeah.
