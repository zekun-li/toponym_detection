Much of the country is unstable, but national

 Allan 
Hi, I'm Allan from ~<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1663328 USGS:1662328" id="Pl-12" latLong="34.052°N 118.243°W" state="US-CA" type="PPL">LA</PLACE>.


 A 
You're from what?


 Allan 
~<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1663328 USGS:1662328" id="Pl-13" latLong="34.052°N 118.243°W" state="US-CA" type="PPL">LA</PLACE>, ~<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1663328 USGS:1662328" id="Pl-14" latLong="34.052°N 118.243°W" state="US-CA" type="PPL">LA</PLACE>.


 A 
Uh-huh.


 Allan 
Um, yeah, ok- um, eh,  uh, it was talking something about, uh,  the
war in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, um,  I guess, yeah, it's a good thing -- about the
elections that are going on.


 A 
Right.  I just talked to somebody from ~<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1663328 USGS:1662328" id="Pl-15" latLong="34.052°N 118.243°W" state="US-CA" type="PPL">LA</PLACE> a couple days ago about
that on the -- survey line.


 Allan 
Oh, the-


 A 
Um,


 Allan 
you got the same topic or-


 A 
yeah, I thought it was the same topic.  So,  huh.  So,


 Allan 
Uh.


 A 
do you think the elections are going to happen?


 Allan 
Sorry?


 A 
Do you think the elections are going to happen?


 Allan 
Yeah, I think the -- I think they're still they're going to go through
even though, uh, even though,  um, what's it called,  that you know of
all the -- turmoil that's happening there and all of the argu- you know,
and all the -- killings and everything. I think it'll still go through,
you know. The -- it's democracy, you know, you have to fight for it.
It's not -- it doesn't come easily, you know.


 A 
Right. Yeah, that's why I think it will, too, because they- they
pushed it in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>.  I mean, uh, excuse me, in <PLACE country="AF" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16632074 NGA:-3367926" id="Pl-16" latLong="33.000°N 65.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Afghanistan</PLACE>.  They kept
on scheduling them and they we're saying, oh, no no no, you know.


 Allan 
Um,  yeah, I think -- you know I think they should have continued to go
through with it, and you know um -- if- if there is -- if there's
problems, you know, just -- still -- don't, you know -- just ignore it, keep
going, you know you can't -- stop, you know,if you already started
something, you know, you should complete it, I think.


 A 
Right.


 Allan 
I mean, if they leave -- if they leave, you know, if the- eh, let's
say they, you know, they just leave right now, you know, the the -- they
can't, you know, I don't think the -- the -- the occupants themselves
regain control and, you know, and mo- and, you know, and -- put down the
power and, you know, an- and control everything they can. They just
need they, you know, they need assistance and to get off -- get off,
you know, on the right step. I think they're going to need the
military to be in there.  And assist them with the elections and they
need to complete the elections and all this.


 A 
Yeah, um,  yeah, I don't know what the end game,  per se, is going to
be there, you know, because,  eh, they- the problem is the- is the
culture, you know, it's -- pretty, uh,  you know, it's really almost
like a modern day Crusades, you know, and that's- that's kind of hard,
you know. A lot of -- there's a lot of embitterment that goes back
generations and stuff, so,  you know, we have -- I don't know, I
always think we have such a short mindset,  uh, but they don't. So,
that's why,  uh, I- I don't know i- There's always going to be
problems there, I just don't -- I don't know how long we should -- be in
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-7" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>.  I mean, definitely to keep it stable.  I- -- eh, I just -- I- I
think the situation could be handled better. I- I thought it was a
great idea fir- them going in there -- and doing what they did but, uh,
they had a short window of opportunity to win over the people and it
didn't happen. I don't know if that was just out of our control or-
or what or if we could've done a better job but, uh,  you know.


 Allan 
Do you support the -- do you- do you support the war?


 A 
What's that now?


 Allan 
Do you support the war?


 A 
Yeah. Yeah, I did at first I just- I just -- I -- don't like the way it
was managed. I think -- I think, uh, they did a great job up front, of
course. You know, they did militarily-wise,  they did an excellent job
but I think they've done a poor job,  you know,  reconstructing and
just controlling the situation. You know, they-


 Allan 
Yeah, I- I agree also. Yeah, I- I mean, I- I did support the war. I
just think that when they went in there, you know they -- they just
didn't -- you know, they didn't i- execute everything correctly, you
know there was problems, you know.


 A 
Yeah.


 Allan 
And I think I mean, that that lead to it, but yeah, I mean they -- I
mean eh you know you're already in it, so you know, you shouldn't --
you can't just walk down and, you know, stop, you got to complete what
you're doing, you know.  So I


 A 
Right.


 Allan 
Yeah, um.


 A 
But, they- they definitely need to take a back seat to some sort --
you know, some sort of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-8" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> government there. I know they set up the
council,  uh, interim council, but that hasn't gone,  you know, perfe-
smoothly.  Um, they still -- Americans have been calling the shots.
So, if they can just sort of make a -- be- get into more of a
supportive role and,  you know, flex their muscles when they need to
and maybe that will help- help,  uh,  squall some of the vi- the
violence. I don't know.  Eh,  if they could've -- if they could've
shored up the borders,  right after going in there, that would've been
a -- that would've been a- a big plus, you know.  I don't know if that
could, uh,  if that's a -- plausible goal or not because, uh, it's just
that- that -- a lot of that's, you know,  uh, weapons and terrorists
have been, you know, getting through the borders, probably from <PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-2548116 IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-18" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Syria</PLACE>.


 Allan 
Yeah.
