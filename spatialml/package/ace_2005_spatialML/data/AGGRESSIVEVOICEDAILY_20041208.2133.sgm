It's Just Armor

Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld took part in a Q&amp;A with the
troops today that was anything but cozy. Disgruntled soldiers complained
to Rumsfeld about long deployments and a lack of armored vehicles and
other equipment. From the Associated Press : &quot;You go to war with the
Army you have,&quot; Rumsfeld replied, &quot;not the Army you might want or wish
to have.&quot;

Spc. Thomas Wilson had asked the defense secretary, &quot;Why do we
soldiers have to dig through local landfills for pieces of scrap metal
and compromised ballistic glass to up-armor our vehicles?&quot; Shouts of
approval and applause arose from the estimated 2,300 soldiers who had
assembled to see Rumsfeld.

&quot;We do not have proper armored vehicles to carry with us north,&quot;
Wilson, 31, of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1653484" id="Pl-1" latLong="36.166°N 86.784°W" state="US-TN" type="PPLA">Nashville</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1326873" id="Pl-2" latLong="35.750°N 86.250°W" state="US-TN" type="CIVIL">Tenn.</PLACE>, concluded after asking again.

Wilson, an airplane mechanic whose unit, the 278th Regimental Combat
Team of the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1326873" id="Pl-3" latLong="35.750°N 86.250°W" predicative="true" state="US-TN" type="CIVIL">Tennessee</PLACE> Army National Guard, is about to drive north into
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> for a one-year tour of duty, put his finger on a problem that has
bedeviled the Pentagon for more than a year. Rarely, though, is it put
so bluntly in a public forum.

Rumsfeld said the Army was sparing no expense or effort to acquire as
many Humvees and other vehicles with extra armor as it can. What is
more, he said, armor is not the savior some think it is.

&quot;You can have all the armor in the world on a tank and a tank can
(still) be blown up,&quot; he said. Can't say that's the most comforting
answer.
