 WOODRUFF 
Thanks, Wolf. And we will see you then. Well, as coalition forces push
ahead in their bid to capture <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-25" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>, big questions remain about Saddam
Hussein and his whereabouts. It is still not clear, looking at the latest
tapes of the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-1" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> president, whether he's dead or alive. CNN senior
international correspondent Nic Robertson, who was expelled from <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-26" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>,
is with us now from the border of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="BORDER" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> and <PLACE country="JO" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19027984" id="Pl-31" latLong="31.000°N 36.000°E" mod="BORDER" type="COUNTRY">Jordan</PLACE>, on the <PLACE country="JO" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19027984" id="Pl-32" latLong="31.000°N 36.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Jordanian</PLACE> side,
to talk about what's happening in the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-3" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-16" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">capital</PLACE>. Nic, we're getting
information in bits and pieces about the incursion by coalition land
forces, about air flights over the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-33" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE>. Help us pull it all together.


 NIC ROBERTSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT 
Well, from what we hear from sources in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-27" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> this evening, it had been
mostly quiet in terms of bombing throughout the day in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-28" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>. Then
there was a large explosion not far from the hotel journalists are
staying in in the center of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-29" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" mod="CENTRAL" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>. Along the riverfront there, there
are a number of Ba'ath Party houses and buildings that appear to be --
have some sort of military function. It's not clear exactly what the
target was. What we're hearing from <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> people in the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-17" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">capital</PLACE> today is
that they know and they have seen coalition forces in the southwest of
the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-34" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" mod="SW" state="BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE>, in the southeast of the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-35" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" mod="SE" state="BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE>. They say they have also seen
coalition forces and believe coalition forces have a checkpoint on the
northern outskirts of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-19" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" mod="N" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> as well. So as far as the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> people are
concerned, they are very aware that coalition forces are right on the
perimeter of the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-36" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" mod="BORDER" state="BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE>. Our sources are also telling us that <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> forces
are massing artillery pieces and tanks at a number of locations on the
southwestern edge of the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-37" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" mod="SW" state="BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE>. These locations, actually, very close to
the center of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-20" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" mod="CENTRAL" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> and appear to be forming something sort of front
line against the coalition forces. Now, <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-7" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>'s minister of information
today said that the coalition did not have control of the airport, that
this was some sort of contrived video from the first day, and that, in
fact, hundreds of coalition soldiers had been killed, and their graves
were now at the airport. He did promise to take journalists to the
airport, however, he never made -- he didn't make good on that promise
throughout the day. The information minister also read a statement from
President Saddam Hussein today, the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-8" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> leader calling on people to be
resolute, to be strong, and saying that if they put up a good fight, then
the coalition would eventually back down.

But to harm the enemy more and more, go against the enemy and destroy the
enemy and follow the plans that you got in writing. God is great. May the
criminals lose.

 ROBERTSON 
Now, representatives of the committee -- the International Committee for
the Red Cross, who have been to some of the hospitals in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-21" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>, report
higher-than-usual numbers of casualties coming into those hospitals.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

 ROLAND NUGUENIN-BENJAMIN, INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS (on phone) 
We had a chance in the morning to go to the main hospital, which is
called Yarmuk (ph), and we found there has been a steady flow in of
hundreds of casualties, all over the night and through into the day,
casualties -- I mean, war wounded had to be sent over, dispatched to
other hospitals, because this Yarmuk was just totally overwhelmed by the
sheer number of people coming in.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

 ROBERTSON 
Now, these Red Cross representatives say that most -- that two-thirds of
the casualties they've seen in this particular hospital are, in fact,
military casualties. And <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-10" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> officials promise to take journalists to
this particular hospital, the Yarmuk Hospital, that is now located, it's
on the southwest of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-22" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" mod="SW" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>, and it appears to be pretty much between the
position of where coalition forces have been seen and where <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-11" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> now has
a militarized front-line position. Now, when journalists were taken to
see that hospital, twice they were turned around and told that they
weren't actually allowed to go inside that hospital, Judy.


 WOODRUFF 
Nic, when you say Iraqis are seen now putting artillery pieces out and
around the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-38" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE>, are you saying out in the open, where they can -- where
they are vulnerable, or are they making any attempt to hide them? Give us
clearer picture of that.


 ROBERTSON 
One of the areas where I understand they're locating tanks and artillery
pieces is the Zawara (ph) Park. This is fairly central in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-23" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> on the
edge of a government area. It is a garden -- it is a large garden-type
area for people to take their children to go and play. It's -- there's a
small zoo there as well. It is, if you will, on the -- facing towards the
southwestern area of the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-39" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" mod="SW" state="BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE>. It faces off against the highway that
leads out to the airport. Now, that is not in a residential area. It is a
clear, open area, apart from trees. The other areas that we understand
where <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-12" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> officials are placing tanks and blocking off streets are in
more residential areas, Judy.


 WOODRUFF 
All right. Nic Robertson, giving us a better understanding of exactly
what the Iraqis are doing to prepare for any further moves by coalition
forces. Nic, thank you very much. Well, as <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-30" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> forces do push ahead
toward the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> government's key center of power, <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-40" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> forces are
keeping up their work to the <SIGNAL id="S-1">south</SIGNAL> of the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-14" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-18" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">capital</PLACE>.
