Struggling Konica and Minolta merged Tuesday to form Konica Minolta
Holdings Inc., <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-3" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE>'s fourth-largest camera and office equipment
maker, a company spokesman said.

Minolta shares, which were delisted in late July, will be exchanged
for 0.621 Konica shares, which were to take the name of the holding
company Tuesday, a company spokesman said.

Minolta Co. Ltd. will be dissolved as a company by October 1.

&quot;We plan to release new digital cameras and other products with the
new brand some time next year,&quot; said spokesman Katsuyuki Sakai.

The merger of the camera and office equipment makers, announced in
January, was made &quot;in order to survive amidst today's global
competition&quot;, the new company said in a release Tuesday.

The company plans to cut 4,000 jobs from the combined workforce of
38,500 and reduce overlaps in plants and stores by March 2006, it
said.

Konica Corp., a camera and film maker, and Minolta Co. Ltd., a
camera, copier and printer firm, have jointly developed and produced
copiers since 2000.

In the year to March 2006, the new company is targeting an operating
profit of 150 billion yen (1.3 billion dollars) on sales of 1.3
trillion yen, making it the fourth-ranked photographic equipment
maker in <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-4" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE> behind leader Canon, Fuji Photo Film and Ricoh.
