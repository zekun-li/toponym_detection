<PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17398111" id="Pl-5" latLong="51.500°N 0.117°W" state="ENG" type="PPLC">LONDON</PLACE>, April 1 (AFP)

<PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-4" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown on Tuesday named the
current head of the <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="GDB:17389505" id="Pl-9" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>'s energy regulator as the new chairman of
finance watchdog the Financial Services Authority (FSA).

Former senior banker Callum McCarthy begins what is one of the most
important jobs in <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17398111" id="Pl-6" latLong="51.500°N 0.117°W" state="ENG" type="PPLC">London</PLACE>'s financial world in September, when
incumbent Howard Davies steps down.

Davies is leaving to become chairman of the <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17398111" id="Pl-7" latLong="51.500°N 0.117°W" state="ENG" type="PPLC">London</PLACE> School of
Economics, one of the best-known parts of the University of <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17398111" id="Pl-8" latLong="51.500°N 0.117°W" state="ENG" type="PPLC">London</PLACE>.

Brown said McCarthy would bring to the FSA &quot;an unrivalled combination
of experience of the public sector, experience as a senior
practitioner in the financial services industry, and chairman of a
highly successful regulator.&quot;

McCarthy currently heads the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets,
or Ofgem, which regulates <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-2" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Britain</PLACE>'s privatised energy industry.

As well as previously holding senior positions at Barclays Bank, BZW
and Kleinwort Benson, McCarthy was formerly a top civil servant at
the Department of Trade and Industry.

Under Davies's watch, the FSA became <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-3" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Britain</PLACE>'s sole regulatory body
for financial services in November 2001, taking on the various
functions of nine separate agencies.
