 HUNT 
John Deardourff, how did you get involved with Gerald Ford?


 JOHN DEARDOURFF, FORD CAMPAIGN CONSULTANT 
Well, the interesting thing is, we almost didn't. In the early stages, we
weren't sure we wanted to do the Ford campaign, and they certainly
weren't sure they wanted to have us.


 HUNT 
The presidential campaign of '76.


 DEARDOURFF 
The -- yes, the campaign in '76. Doug Bailey and I were certainly to the
left of most of the Ford people and the Republican Party. Both of us had
worked for Nelson Rockefeller, and frankly, were not happy that the Ford
campaign had essentially pushed him out of the vice presidential
candidacy in '76. And there were some policy differences that we had with
Ford at that time. But -- and they, frankly, had been faced with the
challenge from Reagan, weren't sure they wanted us involved in a campaign
(UNINTELLIGIBLE)...


 HUNT 
Once you did get in, what was your impression of Gerald Ford?


 DEARDOURFF 
Well, let's -- once we got in, frankly, it was really character trumping
all of our earlier concerns about President Ford. I mean, I came to
believe that this man was one of the most decent, honorable, principled
men I'd ever met in politics. And it was just a pleasure to work with
him.


 HUNT 
In 1976, you were down by 30 points on Labor Day. You almost pulled it
off, losing by about a point, with brilliant but simple and direct ads
like this. Let's take a look.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY">America</PLACE> is smiling again, and a great many people believe that the
leadership of this steady, dependable man can keep <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" type="COUNTRY">America</PLACE> happy and
secure.

 HUNT 
Extraordinary campaign. Did you run out of gas, or did you need a couple
more days?


 DEARDOURFF 
No, well, I think it was really a little bit of running out of gas. We
had come -- we were gaining about a half a percentage point a day
throughout the campaign. We just didn't quite have the juice to get over
the top. The thing about that campaign that is so memorable to me is the
way it was conducted by both campaigns. It really is the last time in
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> presidential campaign politics that the two candidates ended up
liking each other much better after the campaign than they had before.


 HUNT 
If President Ford hadn't pardoned Richard Nixon, would have won that
election?


 DEARDOURFF 
I doubt it. I think that the Nixon trial, whatever would -- I mean, it
would have stretched all through the Ford presidency. And I think Ford
recognized that if he was going to have any chance of healing the wounds
of Watergate, he had to get Nixon off center stage.


 HUNT 
What was Gerald Ford's most notable achievement as president?


 DEARDOURFF 
Well, I think that he restored some modicum of trust in the government. I
mean, people's view of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-9" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="DC" type="PPL">Washington</PLACE> and of the presidency was at such a low
ebb, and Ford, largely through his own personality, was able to really
lift up people's spirits. And I think the commercials that we ran in that
campaign, and the theme of his making us feel -- we're feeling good again
about <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" type="COUNTRY">America</PLACE>, was really the whole point.


 HUNT 
It's been over 26 years since Gerald Ford left the presidency. He's going
to be 90 years old next week. He's really been a pretty active and pretty
contributory ex-president, hasn't he?


 DEARDOURFF 
He's been not -- more than -- I -- I mean, in my view, more importantly,
he and Betty Ford have been the happiest of couples. I think those years
in public life were hard on her and hard on him as a result. To see the
two of them able to live out a life after politics and to be such useful
contributors, both of them -- And of course the same thing is true with
Jimmy Carter. I think they are wonderful examples of how to live your
life after you're out of politics.


 HUNT 
John, thanks. Happy birthday to...


 DEARDOURFF 
Absolutely.


 HUNT 
... ex-president Ford...

 SHIELDS 
Al Hunt, since Gerald, Gerald, Ronald Reagan's emergence and dominance of
the Republican Party in 1980, has Gerald Ford been estranged from
prevailing Republican ideology?


 HUNT 
Well, certainly the party has moved to the right since then, Mark, but --
and it's interesting, Ford people dominated both the first Bush
administration and dominate policy today, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Alan
Greenspan, even though the party has moved to the right. But we just owe
Gerry Ford on the eve of his 91st day a tremendous debt for what he did
back in those tough times.
