 Christina 
Hello?


 Salford 
Hi.


 Christina 
Hi.


 Salford 
Uh, Salford in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772 USGS:975772" id="Pl-1" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL">New York</PLACE>.


 Christina 
Oh, I'm Christina from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780780 USGS:1779780" id="Pl-2" latLong="41.667°N 72.667°W" state="CT" type="CIVIL">Connecticut</PLACE>.


 Salford 
How are you?


 Christina 
Okay, how are you?


 Salford 
That's close enough.


 Christina 
Yeah.


 Salford 
Oh, I'm fine, thanks.


 Christina 
Have you, um, been flying since...


 Salford 
Oh, I have. I I was -- uh, yeah, I have. I I tend to take, um, not a
lot of business flights, but uh, vacation.


 Christina 
Uh-huh.


 Salford 
I have to get out of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772 USGS:975772" id="Pl-3" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL">New York</PLACE>, if you know what I mean.


 Christina 
Uh-huh.


 Salford 
I'm -- I would say obviously, um, it's not the same for pre-eleven.


 Christina 
Yeah.


 Salford 
I mean, we live in in an <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:976772 USGS:975772" id="Pl-7" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" mod="E" state="NY" type="RGN">area</PLACE> where -- in an ot- east where I think
everything happened, so I think it's a little more uh, difficult here
to travel. I- I- we waited hours just to- to board on planes and, um,
and I know the wife had -- she had her hair done and she had pins up
there and they had made her took every one of them out, so.


 Christina 
Oh, really.


 Salford 
Yeah. Yeah. It's -- so it's been one of those. I I think it's been,
eh -- it it has changed li- my life, so.


 Christina 
Huh. Uh-huh.


 Salford 
Uh, used to be so easy to just show your ticket, you board, but now
you have to go through so many screening areas. I don't know about
you.


 Christina 
You know, actually, I- I've -- I haven't traveled
and my my husband is actually -- definitely never going -- he he was
scared before flying and now he won't even get on a plane. But we've
had two -- we've had -- let's see, my daughter was born September
fifth and then September eleven happened.


 Salford 
Oh. Uh-huh. Oh.


 Christina 
And then I had another one and I -- we haven't got any work so I I
quit my job and I'm <PLACE id="Pl-174" type="FAC">home</PLACE> so, we can't -- we can't afford to f- travel
really anywhere so we haven't.


 Salford 
Noth- nothing wrong with that. Uh-huh, I see.


 Christina 
But I hear from people like my, um, my brother-in-law lives in
<PLACE country="ID" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-2679462 IGDB:17320538" id="Pl-8" latLong="5.000°S 120.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Indonesia</PLACE>.


 Salford 
Right.


 Christina 
And he comes here a couple times a year and he always says how, you
know, it's -- you have to be there a lot earlier at the airport.


 Salford 
Yeah.


 Christina 
And you know...


 Salford 
It's a different world.


 Christina 
It's a different world and it'll never be back to what it used to be.


 Salford 
You...


 Salford 
I love flying. 


 Christina 
You know, I do too. Mhm.


 Salford 
I I can easily just sit back and and close my eyes and take it all in.


 Christina 
Yes.


 Salford 
But now I'm mor- I'm much more aware of my surroundings.


 Christina 
More aware, yeah. You don't just like sit back and like, oh you
never know, right?


 Salford 
Yeah. Yeah. Because -- God, it's probably -- I love to fly but
I don't think I want to die that way.


 Christina 
Mhm.


 Salford 
Uh-huh. Right.


 Christina 
You know what's so weird, like last night I don't know just watching the
news I I'm uh -- I'm watching so much of the news but -- I had a dream of
the pla- -- a plane crashing, like coming down.  And my cousin was on it.


 Salford 
Uh. Oh boy.


 Christina 
And I told her today and I said, you know, and then I said I --
well, I went in with my uncle looking for her, into the water.


 Salford 
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.


 Christina 
And he's like, oh my God, what do your dreams mean
and I'm like, I don't know. I don't know what it means. I watch too
much of the news, I said, maybe.


 Salford 
Yeah, but some people would -- some people would analyze that dream so
ho- if you know what I mean, you know?


 Christina 
But -- Yeah. Yeah, they would. So, I'm like, I don't know what it
means then.


 Salford 
Exactly.


 Christina 
You know, so, but, like, I I s- like my my, uh, mom -- dad's family
lives in <PLACE country="PL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:20099514 NGA:99514" id="Pl-9" latLong="52.000°N 20.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Poland</PLACE>, so I've been to <PLACE country="PL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:20099514 NGA:99514" id="Pl-10" latLong="52.000°N 20.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Poland</PLACE> fourteen times, so...


 Salford 
Uh-huh. I see. I see.


 Christina 
You know, it's travel and it was like a nine hour flight.


 Salford 
Right, that's a pretty long flight.


 Christina 
Mhm.  But, like, now, and I know if I ever do get back on a plane like I
will, you know, the longer you're not on a plane -- I haven't been
on a plane for actually four years, the last time I was on a plane.
Yeah, so it made me really nervous.


 Salford 
Oh, it's been a while then. We we -- Yeah, I see. Well, th- we
tend to take vacations. I -- we work hard, so we're a working family and
I just believe in getting up and going away, especially down to the
<PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:209103520" id="Pl-11" type="WATER">Caribbean</PLACE> and and that sort of a thing and...


 Christina 
Yeah. Uh-huh.


 Salford 
I'm on the phone, I'm sorry. So...


 Christina 
I'm on the phone, I'm going to get paid for this right now.


 Salford 
Um, yeah, eh, exactly we get paid for this so I...


 Christina 
Yeah.


 Salford 
So it's, um,


 Christina 
Um, yeah.


 Salford 
i- it- i- it -- I- I think it's necessary, obviously because, you
know, there're enemies out there, um.


 Christina 
Yeah.


 Salford 
But some of it, I don't know if it gets too -- maybe it's just a
little bit too much, um.


 Christina 
Mhm.


 Salford 
To me anyway. I- I- I guess -- I guess it's necessary but I- I think
some of it is just too much. Um.


 Christina 
Yeah.


 Salford 
That's how I feel.


 Christina 
Right.


 Salford 
I mean, I think other people I think -- I think most people want it
to be as strenuous a- and as difficult as it is to board an airplane,
but i- in -- I don't know. It's a touchy -- I don't think it's a
touchy issue. I guess it depends on how- how you feel about it. I- I
know n- -- I know one thing. I think the cockpit, I think that was the
most important thing that they could've done, restricting the cockpit
-- the cockpit.


 Christina 
Mhm. Yeah.


 Salford 
Cockpit. I think that alone -- I think that alone should should...
And the fact that th- there're air marshals now on board.


 Christina 
Are they really? There are now marshals? Yeah, mhm. On most air- ...


 Salford 
um Yeah. Yeah, oh, I mean, those guys are -- yeah, and I think
they gave them the okay to also, uh, to go on board with weapons.


 Christina 
Mos- most airlines or almost all?


 Salford 
Most airlines I I think -- most airlines. Not on every flight,
though.


 Christina 
Really? No?


 Salford 
I think they pick and choose.


 Christina 
They pick and choose.


 Salford 
Eh, I would imagine it's probably more on international flights than
it is domestic. I mean, because they think terrorists is coming in,
not going out. But...


 Christina 
Uh-huh. Right. Right.


 Salford 
I I I don't know. I think it's kind of dangerous to have a gun on
board and you can depressurize the cabin if a shot goes off for crying
out loud. But, I I don't know, it it...


 Christina 
Yeah. Yeah.


 Salford 
It it depends. Um.


 Christina 
Yeah. I know, ah.


 Salford 
Ah, especially living in this part of the country, I think everyone -- 
uh, everyone's nerves is up, eh.


 Christina 
Yeah, well, yeah, I mean, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772 USGS:975772" id="Pl-4" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL">New York</PLACE>, you're still like, you hear about
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772 USGS:975772" id="Pl-5" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL">New York</PLACE>. It's like, okay would <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772 USGS:975772" id="Pl-6" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL">New York</PLACE> get hit again, you know.


 Salford 
Yeah, exactly.


 Christina 
Um, but, you know, I don't know if they would even hit by, like, go by
planes. I mean, you hear different things, I mean...


 Salford 
Yeah.


 Christina 
Hurt us. You know, there's other way they could hurt us with the
bridges.


 Salford 
E- exactly.


 Christina 
Oh my God, that would like...


 Salford 
I think -- I think those guys are so weakened right now. I don't know
how in the world they can get into this <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-12" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>, i- it's amazing to
me.
