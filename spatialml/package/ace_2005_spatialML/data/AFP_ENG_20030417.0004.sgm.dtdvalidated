At least three members of a family in <PLACE country="IN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17902205" id="Pl-3" latLong="20.000°N 77.000°E" mod="NE" type="COUNTRY">India</PLACE>s northeastern state of

witchcraft, police said Thursday.

A spokesman said a group of 25 to 30 armed men Wednesday attacked a
<PLACE country="IN" form="NOM" id="Pl-14" type="FAC">house</PLACE> belonging to a <PLACE country="IN" form="NOM" id="Pl-10" state="IN-TR" type="PPL">village</PLACE> quack doctor in <PLACE country="IN" form="NAM" id="Pl-11" state="IN-TR" type="PPL">Tultuli</PLACE>, <SIGNAL id="S-1">60 kilometers
(38 miles)</SIGNAL> <SIGNAL id="S-2">south</SIGNAL> of <PLACE country="IN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17886549" id="Pl-8" latLong="24.000°N 92.000°E" state="IN-TR" type="CIVIL">Tripura</PLACE>s state capital <PLACE country="IN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17911787" id="Pl-9" latLong="23.836°N 91.275°E" state="IN-TR" type="PPLA">Agartala</PLACE>.

&quot;The mob dragged out three members of a family and (killed) them with
machetes and spears before fleeing the area,&quot; the spokesman said by
telephone from <PLACE country="IN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17911787" id="Pl-12" latLong="23.836°N 91.275°E" state="IN-TR" type="PPLA">Agartala</PLACE>.

The dead included the quack doctor, 55-year-old Nityalila Naotia, his
teenaged son and another member of the family, whom he did not
identify.

&quot;It was believed Naotia was a practicing sorcerer and through his
black magic he had cast evil spells on villagers, prompting a group
within the <PLACE country="IN" form="NOM" id="Pl-13" state="IN-TR" type="PPL">village</PLACE> to eliminate them,&quot; the spokesman said.

Police have arrested four people in connection with the killings.

Superstitious beliefs, black magic and demonology are integral to the
tribal custom in parts of <PLACE country="IN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17886549" id="Pl-6" latLong="24.000°N 92.000°E" state="IN-TR" type="CIVIL">Tripura</PLACE> and other northeast <PLACE country="IN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17902205" id="Pl-4" latLong="20.000°N 77.000°E" mod="NE" type="COUNTRY">Indian</PLACE> states.

Many tribes practice faiths believed to be a mix of black magic and
superstition.
