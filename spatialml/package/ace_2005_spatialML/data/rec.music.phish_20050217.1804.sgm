Ok, so if <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-5" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iran</PLACE> is saying that they are moving forward with their
nuclear programs for science and friendly nuclear energy, why is the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-34" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>
so worried? They are just trying to produce energy, as we have several
nuclear power plants. And all the demands to <PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-38" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Syria</PLACE>...this all seems so
predictable. And if you were wondering, this is the link I got that
from...

I like this quote the best, but I am sure it means nothing to us (us
being the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-35" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>'s powers that be)...&quot;The <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-6" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iranian</PLACE> nation is not looking for
war, violence and confrontation,&quot; Khatami said. Well guess what
Khatami, you're in for it.

because they are lying.

    

they are one of the worlds biggest suppliers of oil. why do they need a
nuclear power plant?

    

you have no problems with <PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-40" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" type="COUNTRY">syria</PLACE>?

    

so you believe him when he says that <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-8" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" type="COUNTRY">iran</PLACE> isn't looking for it, but you
don't believe the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-36" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> when we say that we aren't?

About 3 days ago I said to my wife.....&quot;shit in the world is going to
get ugly fast.&quot;  And although I wish we wouldn't have to do this....we
may have to flex our muscle again soon.  I think we are screwed with
<PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-44" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">N.

<PLACE country="LB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19193726" id="Pl-45" latLong="33.833°N 35.833°E" type="COUNTRY">Lebanon</PLACE> may cause them to get their ass handed to them soon.

please. this is a cop-out response. the reason we are so worried is
because we are on a higher level than 90% of the world because we have
nucler weapons. if countries we don't like start developing nuclear
weapons-grade material it makes us nervous. although so far, <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-12" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" type="COUNTRY">iran</PLACE> has
shown that they are *not* producing weapons-grade material and are in fact
using their nuclear power for just that, according to the IAEA. but when
you have a sitting president who has an infatuation with provoking other
countries into a war, you can bet that he will try everything he can to
try to prove his case against <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-13" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" type="COUNTRY">iran</PLACE>.

    

maybe because oil is a much bigger polluting source of energy than
nuclear? or maybe because it's more cost effective for them to use
nuclear than any other method? why should they run their energy supply
off of one of their backbone industries when oil is worth more to them on
the open market?

we are definitely trying to do too many things at once, but <PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-43" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" type="COUNTRY">syria</PLACE> has been
fucking with the lebanese since before we came along. it's only becoming
more noticeable because there is so much *more* focus on the <PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208667208" id="Pl-48" type="RGN">middle east</PLACE>
right now than ever before.

it's not a question of whether i believe <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-16" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" type="COUNTRY">iran</PLACE> is telling the truth. the
question was asked: why is the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-37" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> scared of <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-17" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" type="COUNTRY">iran</PLACE>, and your response was
&quot;because they're lying&quot;. this is a cop-out because you're not really
proving anything, you're just making accusations without proof.

    

ok, they made a very very small amount of a material that could maybe be
used in a weapon if they had more of it possibly. but the fact is that
<PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-18" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" type="COUNTRY">iran</PLACE> is cooperating with most of the international community on this
issue, whether your believe them or not.

    

this was about nuclear proliferation, not <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-24" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">iraq</PLACE>'s insurgency. i think that
if they have proof of <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-19" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" type="COUNTRY">iran</PLACE>'s assistance to <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-25" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">iraqi</PLACE> insurgents that it can be
dealt with later, once <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-26" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">iraq</PLACE> is secure and able to handle its own affairs.
for now, we were talking about the <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-20" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">iranian</PLACE> nuclear program, not <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-27" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">iraq</PLACE>.

if you choose to believe them, that is your choice. i'll go with the
IAEA, the europeans and the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-31" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> who believe that <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-22" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" type="COUNTRY">iran</PLACE> is lying. i tend to
believe the free countries of the <PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208561573" id="Pl-49" type="RGN">west</PLACE> over a closed fundamentalist gov't
like

    

not if you have a meltdown or need to get rid of spent fuel rods. also, i
would doubt one of the biggest exporters of oil is that concerned with
being environmentally

    

<PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-39" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" type="COUNTRY">syria</PLACE> has occupied <PLACE country="LB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19193726" id="Pl-46" latLong="33.833°N 35.833°E" type="COUNTRY">lebanon</PLACE>, they are in violation of security council
resolution 1559 stating that there should be no foreign forces in <PLACE country="LB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19193726" id="Pl-47" latLong="33.833°N 35.833°E" type="COUNTRY">lebanon</PLACE>
and that <PLACE country="LB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19193726" id="Pl-50" latLong="33.833°N 35.833°E" type="COUNTRY">lebabon</PLACE> should be allowed to have free elections. our alliance
to them is supporting people that want to have a free democratically
elected gov't.

    

finish the statement: then we will refer them to the security council.

what exactly is wrong with that? that is the type of diplomatic solution
that all of the anti-war people wanted for <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-28" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">iraq</PLACE>. of course a whole bunch
of resolutions did nothing in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-29" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">iraq</PLACE>, but who knows, maybe this time they
will work.

personally, based on the aggressive stance they have taken and the way
they are helping the insurgency in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-30" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">iraq</PLACE>, i tend to not believe them when
they say that they aren't looking for a confrontation.
