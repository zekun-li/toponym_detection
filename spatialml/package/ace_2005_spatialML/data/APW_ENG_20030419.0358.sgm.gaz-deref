Shaquille O'Neal's wife gave birth to a baby boy early Saturday,
eliminating any chance that the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1663328 USGS:1662328" id="Pl-3" latLong="34.052°N 118.243°W" predicative="true" state="US-CA" type="PPL">Los Angeles</PLACE> Lakers center might skip
a playoff game to witness the birth.

Shaunie O'Neal gave birth to the couple's third child at 1:52 a.m. at
a <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1663328 USGS:1662328" id="Pl-4" latLong="34.052°N 118.243°W" predicative="true" state="US-CA" type="PPL">Los Angeles</PLACE>-area <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-26" type="FAC">hospital</PLACE>, team spokesman John Black said. He did
not provide the baby's name or other details.

O'Neal was excused from Saturday's practice. He was scheduled to fly
on his own to <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:655030 IGDB:656030" id="Pl-6" latLong="44.980°N 93.264°W" state="US-MN" type="PPL">Minneapolis</PLACE> late Saturday for Sunday's opening game of
a first-round playoff series against the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:662849 IGDB:663849" id="Pl-9" latLong="46.250°N 94.250°W" predicative="true" state="US-MN" type="CIVIL">Minnesota</PLACE> Timberwolves.

``We're really happy for the delivery of a child and the fact that
everything's safe and sound and we can go forward from there,'' coach
Phil Jackson said. ``Hopefully he can get to <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:655030 IGDB:656030" id="Pl-7" latLong="44.980°N 93.264°W" state="US-MN" type="PPL">Minneapolis</PLACE>, get some
rest and be ready to play the first game. That's a pivotal game for
every team.''

O'Neal had said he could not rule out missing a game to witness the
birth. The due date was April 27, the same day as Game 4 of the
best-of-seven series between the Timberwolves and the Lakers.

Teammate Kobe Bryant said he would not be surprised if O'Neal had a
big game Sunday despite his expected late arrival in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:655030 IGDB:656030" id="Pl-8" latLong="44.980°N 93.264°W" state="US-MN" type="PPL">Minneapolis</PLACE>.

``You just roll off the adrenaline,'' said Bryant, who scored 48
points in a 2001 playoff game at <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1660564 USGS:1659564" id="Pl-5" latLong="38.582°N 121.493°W" state="US-CA" type="PPLA">Sacramento</PLACE> after leaving the team to
attend to a personal matter.

The birth comes days after the death of O'Neal's maternal
grandfather, Sirlester O'Neal. Funeral services are expected to be
held this week in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780799 USGS:1779799" id="Pl-10" latLong="34.000°N 81.000°W" state="US-SC" type="CIVIL">South Carolina</PLACE>, Black said. O'Neal is expected to
attend.
