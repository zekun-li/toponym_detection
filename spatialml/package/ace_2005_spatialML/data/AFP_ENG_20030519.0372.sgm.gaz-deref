Shiite Muslims in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-9" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> Monday celebrated openly for the first time in

Thousands of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>'s majority Shiite Muslims marched to their main

Mohammed.

Shiites, who celebrate the birthday a week later than Sunni Muslims,
were forbidden to publicly mark the date under the regime of Saddam
Hussein's Sunni-dominated regime.

The crowd filled the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-49" state="IQ-BG" type="ROAD">street</PLACE> leading to the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3102549 IGDB:16897451" id="Pl-41" latLong="33.377°N 44.337°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPL">Kazimiya</PLACE> <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-48" state="IQ-BG" type="FAC">mosque</PLACE> in the
northeast of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-29" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" mod="NE" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> and carried banners in the green color of Islam,
calling for good government.

&quot;No to injustice,&quot; &quot;No to occupation,&quot; &quot;No to Israel,&quot; &quot;Yes to
Islam,&quot; chanted the demonstrators as speeches began from a platform.

Imam Mohammad al-Fartussi, who last week threatened violence against
&quot;sinful&quot; women, alcohol vendors and cinemas showing &quot;indecent&quot; films,
offered praise for the fall of Saddam and called <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-14" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> &quot;the land of
imams... land of Islam.&quot;

The demonstration came as <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-15" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>'s top <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> overseer Paul Bremer began
his second week on the job amid continuing lawlessness in the
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-26" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>.

In his frenzied first seven days, the telegenic Bremer repeatedly
promised to restore the law and order that crumbled along with Saddam
Hussein's regime nearly six weeks ago.

But despite issuing a host of tough decrees, Bremer has failed to
stem the rampant crime and street violence plaguing the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-27" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>.

Despite a security crackdown over the weekend in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-30" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> and an
announcement that some 7,000 policemen had returned to their jobs
since the end of the war, ordinary Iraqis still felt unsafe on the
street with gunfire rife and police a near invisible presence.

In <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-31" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>, almost all the police stations have been destroyed or
looted since <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> troops took control of the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-35" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">capital</PLACE> on April 9. Only
two have so far reopened, and they have no equipment whatsoever.
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-32" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>'s top police job remains vacant.

And a trip to <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-33" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>'s looter <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-50" state="IQ-BG" type="FAC">market</PLACE> only bears witness to the fact
that criminals are ruling the roost in the post-Saddam era.

Packed with the piles of stolen goods picked up during the frenzy of
theft that followed the collapse of Saddam's regime, the traders deal
in everything from computers and stereos to furniture and weapons.

Jalal Jamil, a 45-year-old jewellery <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-51" predicative="true" state="IQ-BG" type="FAC">store</PLACE> owner, said the situation
just keeps getting worse. &quot;The Americans encourage people to steal
because when looting happens right under their noses they do
nothing,&quot; he said.

Bremer has also been criticized for backing away from an earlier <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>
timeline on forming a government in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-16" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, but <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>-led coalition
officials Monday insisted government plans were still on track.

&quot;We want to have an <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-17" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> voice in everything we do here but it would
be wrong to do that precipitously,&quot; said a source at the Organisation
of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA), which is
administering post-war <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-18" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>.

Officials from <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-19" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> groups that met with Bremer last week have said
that he back peddled on what they said were earlier pledges to give
them a lead role in forming a new interim government in the next few
weeks.

&quot;We understand that they want to have as much power as possible but
we told them: 'You won't be directly elected, you won't have any
direct experience of government,&quot; the source said.

&quot;'Of course you will have input into the government but, since you
are not directly elected, it would be a nonsense for you to have
direct executive power,' the source said.

&quot;The last thing we want is to leave a bunch of self-appointed
oligarchs in power,&quot; the source said.

The comments came on the same day that a prominent Iraqi called for
internationally-supervised elections in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-20" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>.

Adnan Pachachi, a onetime foreign minister who returned to <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-21" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> on
May 6 after 33 years in exile, told the independent Az-Zaman daily
that elections should be held under international supervision.

An interim government should create an election code and laws to
clear the way for direct elections to a constituent assembly, that
would draw up a constitution, Pachachi said.

A referendum on the constitution would lead to elections for a new
government, the 80-year-old Pachachi told the daily.

On the diplomatic front, a top <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-2994055 IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-37" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Russian</PLACE> official said Monday that the
UN Security Council would likely vote this week on a <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-7" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>-<PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-2610495 IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-42" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> draft
resolution to lift economic sanctions placed on <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-22" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> in 1990 after
its invasion of <PLACE country="KW" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-789772 IGDB:19210228" id="Pl-44" latLong="29.500°N 47.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Kuwait</PLACE> and to place its oil riches under coalition
control for at least a year.

&quot;An updated text of the document may already be published today and
may be put to a vote this week,&quot; Deputy Foreign Minister Yury Fedotov
told ITAR-TASS news agency.

Yet Fedotov did not say whether <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-2994055 IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-38" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Russia</PLACE> would back the resolution,
which diplomats have been revising since the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE>, <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-2610495 IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-43" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Britain</PLACE>

be,&quot; he said.

With billions of dollars in oil and debt interests in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-23" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-2994055 IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-40" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Russia</PLACE>

resolution.
