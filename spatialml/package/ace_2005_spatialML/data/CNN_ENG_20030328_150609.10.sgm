reporter: and this is a military <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-5" state="US-TX">town</PLACE>, judy and little by little we
are seeing these soldiers head out. in a strange way and this may
sound unusual, there's a little sense of relief because these soldiers
were set to leave in january and now they got second deployment
orders, the delay, of course, the inability to get access to <PLACE country="TR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19226169" id="Pl-6" latLong="39.000°N 35.000°E" type="COUNTRY">turkey</PLACE>,

to note some of the equipment that's been held up for the last couple
of months, there are some 5 helicopters, 200 tanks as well as 150
bradley infantry fighting vehicles. these are highly trained soldiers.
they are ready to go. they are happy to be finally able to come and
