Back now to the battlefront and to the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-21" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="S" type="COUNTRY">southern</PLACE> city

could have gone either way today. Armed coalition soldiers moving toward
a venerated <PLACE id="Pl-240" type="FAC">mosque</PLACE> at the request of a Muslim cleric, but angry locals
who didn't understand what they were trying to do. CNN's Ryan Chilcote is
in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897127 NGA:-3102873" id="Pl-18" latLong="31.992°N 44.351°E" state="NA" type="PPLA">Najaf</PLACE> with the 101st Airborne.

turns up nothing. The only resistance comes from a Volvo. The Shia
population seems curious and friendly but they don't get too close. This
man agrees to be interviewed as long as his face isn't shown. The <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-1" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE>
government, he says, has satellite TV. Anybody could be an informer and
punish us for talking to you, even my family, he tells me in Arabic. The
troops also keep their distance.


 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
Yes, it's very uneasy out here. Don't know who's who.

highly sensitive <PLACE id="Pl-227" type="FAC">Imam Ali Shrine</PLACE>, one of the holiest <PLACE id="Pl-223" type="FAC">sites</PLACE> in the world
for Shia Muslims. Does it make you nervous that you're so close to the
<PLACE id="Pl-229" type="FAC">Ali mosque</PLACE>? Do you feel like you're tramping on.


 SGT. ROD SUTTON, BASTOGNE BRIGADE 
Holy ground?


 CHILCOTE 
Yes.


 SUTTON 
To some extent, I feel fortunate that I'm here, because this is something
I never would have seen before. And now that I see it I kind of
understand some of the history behind it. So, it makes me more
appreciative of it. To the same extent, I don't want to be invasive with
these people here. I don't want to trample on their holy ground, and I
want to respect that as much as I can.


 CHILCOTE 
Word comes from the grand Ayatollah Sistani that he's willing to meet the
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> commander, but he asks first for soldiers to secure his

that to the crowd. (on camera): There is no more striking example of the
sensitivities that the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> soldiers face here than what is taking place
on the <PLACE id="Pl-243" type="FAC">streets</PLACE> right up from the <PLACE id="Pl-236" type="FAC">ah Ali mosque</PLACE> right now. (voice-over):
Chaos as the crowd apparently believes the soldiers want to approach the
<PLACE id="Pl-237" type="FAC">shrine</PLACE>.



 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
They want to get inside the holy <PLACE id="Pl-238" type="FAC">shrine of Imam Ali</PLACE>.


 CHILCOTE 
Clerics appear with a message from the grand Ayatollah, but the message
is did drowned out. The colonel instructs his men to stay calm.


 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
They got to understand, he wants us here. Smile, relax.


 CHILCOTE 
His soldiers take a knee, their weapons brought down from the ready
position. They do everything soldiers can to appear less hostile. But the
potential for confrontation remains. The commander makes the decision.


 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
Turn around, just turn around and go.


 CHILCOTE 
He orders his men back to their <PLACE id="Pl-244" type="FAC">compound</PLACE> to await cooler heads. Ryan
Chilcote, CNN with the 101st Airborne in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897127 NGA:-3102873" id="Pl-20" latLong="31.992°N 44.351°E" state="NA" type="PPLA">Najaf</PLACE>, <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>.

And CNN's Nic Robertson telling us earlier, significant that the Shia

investigating two possible friendly fire incidents in which coalition
