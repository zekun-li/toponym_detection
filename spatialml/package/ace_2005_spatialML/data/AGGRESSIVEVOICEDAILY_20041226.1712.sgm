Peyton Manning broke Dan Marino's season touchdown record today with
49 against the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1662377" id="Pl-1" latLong="32.715°N 117.156°W" predicative="true" state="US-CA" type="PPL">San Diego</PLACE> Chargers in a thrilling game that ended in
overtime. I was happy to see Manning break the record, as last week he
decided to take a knee to end the game against the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:598040" id="Pl-2" latLong="39.290°N 76.612°W" predicative="true" state="US-MD" type="PPL">Baltimore</PLACE> Ravens when
he could have tried to increase the lead even more by throwing a
touchdown. Manning is all class and ranks with the best quarterbacks of
all time. Marino's 48 TD record was set in 1984.

On a much sadder note, the Minister of Defense, Reggie White, died of
heart attack this morning in his <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-124" type="FAC">home</PLACE> at the age of 43. White played a
total of 15 years with <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1210052" id="Pl-3" latLong="39.952°N 75.164°W" state="US-PA" type="PPL">Philadelphia</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1566801" id="Pl-5" latLong="44.519°N 88.020°W" state="US-WI" type="PPL">Green Bay</PLACE> and <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1028616" id="Pl-4" latLong="35.501°N 80.001°W" state="US-NC" type="CIVIL">Carolina</PLACE>. He retired
after the 2000 season as the NFL's all-time leader in sacks with 198.
The mark has since been passed by Bruce Smith.

White will surely be missed.
