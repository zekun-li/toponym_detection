<PLACE country="ID" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17323228" id="Pl-1" latLong="8.650°S 115.217°E" state="BA" type="PPLA">DENPASAR</PLACE>, <PLACE country="ID" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17320538" id="Pl-2" latLong="5.000°S 120.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Indonesia</PLACE>, July 2 (AFP)

Three witnesses said Wednesday that alleged <PLACE country="ID" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17328623" id="Pl-6" latLong="8.333°S 115.000°E" state="BA" type="RGN">Bali</PLACE> bombing mastermind
Imam Samudra had asked them if they were willing to become suicide
bombers.

They were testifying in the trial of Samudra, 33, who is accused of
plotting the terror bombing of two <PLACE country="ID" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17328623" id="Pl-7" latLong="8.333°S 115.000°E" state="BA" type="RGN">Bali</PLACE> nightspots in an attack that
killed 202 people on this <PLACE country="ID" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17320538" id="Pl-3" latLong="5.000°S 120.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Indonesian</PLACE> resort <PLACE country="ID" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:17328623" id="Pl-13" latLong="8.333°S 115.000°E" state="BA" type="RGN">island</PLACE> last October.

Two of the witnesses said they had only discussed with Samudra plans
to help Muslims in the religiously divided Ambon and Poso regions and
had no knowledge about any plans to stage bombings in <PLACE country="ID" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17328623" id="Pl-8" latLong="8.333°S 115.000°E" state="BA" type="RGN">Bali</PLACE>.

&quot;I was hesitant. Shahid (martyrdom) bombing? In <PLACE country="ID" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17320538" id="Pl-4" latLong="5.000°S 120.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Indonesia</PLACE>?&quot; asked
Abdul Rauf.

Another witness, Junaedi, alias Amin, testified that Samudra once
asked him: &quot;Are you ready to carry a martyr's bomb?&quot; Junaedi, an
accomplice in a robbery to help fund the bombings, said he did not
reply.

Police accused regional terror group Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), which is
believed linked to al-Qaeda, of staging the bombing of <PLACE continent="AI" country="ID" form="NOM" id="P-21" type="FAC">nightspots</PLACE>
crowded with <PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208561573" id="Pl-14" type="RGN">Western</PLACE> holidaymakers to avenge perceived injustices
against Muslims worldwide.

Rauf is on trial for robbing a jewellery shop in Banten to fund the
<PLACE country="ID" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17328623" id="Pl-9" latLong="8.333°S 115.000°E" state="BA" type="RGN">Bali</PLACE> bombings. Like Samudra, he has been described as a computer
expert.

One of Rauf's accomplices in the robbery, Andri Oktavia, said he was
&quot;doubtful&quot; about the possibility of staging a suicide attack.

&quot;It was only Iqbal who expressed readiness,&quot; Oktavia told judges.

Prosecutors say Iqbal detonated an explosives-stuffed vest he was
wearing inside <PLACE continent="AI" country="ID" form="NAM" id="P-22" state="BA" type="FAC">Paddy's Bar</PLACE>. Seconds later a man called Arnasan
detonated a huge van bomb outside the nearby <PLACE continent="AI" country="ID" form="NAM" id="P-23" state="BA" type="FAC">Sari Club</PLACE>.

Arnasan died but it was unclear if he intended to be a suicide
bomber.

The disclosure that at least one suicide bomber was involved in the
<PLACE country="ID" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17328623" id="Pl-10" latLong="8.333°S 115.000°E" state="BA" type="RGN">Bali</PLACE> attack heightened concern among security forces in <PLACE continent="AI" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:30009613" id="Pl-15" mod="SE" type="CONTINENT">Southeast
Asia</PLACE>, where such tactics were previously unknown.

Rauf and Oktavia said they gave the stolen gold bars from the
jewellery store to Samudra and said the proceeds from the sale were
supposed to be used for jihad (holy war or struggle) to help Muslims
in Ambon and Poso.

&quot;We trusted him. We were determined to help oppressed Muslims in
<PLACE country="ID" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17329726" id="Pl-16" latLong="3.717°S 128.200°E" state="MA" type="PPLA">Ambon</PLACE> and <PLACE country="ID" form="NAM" id="Pl-18" type="PPL">Poso</PLACE>,&quot; Oktavia said.

<PLACE country="ID" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17329726" id="Pl-17" latLong="3.717°S 128.200°E" state="MA" type="PPLA">Ambon</PLACE> and <PLACE country="ID" form="NAM" id="Pl-19" type="PPL">Poso</PLACE> have been the scene of clashes between Muslims and
Christians, leaving thousands dead and a trail of destruction.

Both Rauf and Oktavia said they used three handguns lent to them by
Samudra in the robbery.

Samudra, who police say has admitted ordering the <PLACE country="ID" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17328623" id="Pl-11" latLong="8.333°S 115.000°E" state="BA" type="RGN">Bali</PLACE> attack, denied
that he conspired with the witnesses to rob the jewellery shop.

&quot;They did not say that the guns were to be used in a robbery. As far
as I knew they borrowed them for jihad,&quot; Samudra told the court.

&quot;If I had known they were to be used in a robbery I wouldn't have
lent them,&quot; he said, adding that robberies were forbidden in Islam.

Oktavia said at first he thought the robbery was justified.

&quot;I was thinking that maybe it was okay to rob Chinese. They are rich
while most people in <PLACE country="ID" form="NAM" id="Pl-20" type="PPL">Banten</PLACE> are very poor. Besides... I was not going
to use the money myself. It was for oppressed people,&quot; he said.

&quot;But after thinking it over, it was somewhat wrong,&quot; he said.

Rauf and Oktavia said Samudra took them to <PLACE country="ID" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17328623" id="Pl-12" latLong="8.333°S 115.000°E" state="BA" type="RGN">Bali</PLACE> before the bombings
but they did not know why.

Rauf said Samudra allowed them to return and told him: &quot;You can
always wage jihad anywhere.&quot;

Junaedi said Samudra once showed him <PLACE continent="AI" country="ID" form="NAM" id="P-24" state="BA" type="FAC">Paddy's</PLACE> and the <PLACE continent="AI" country="ID" form="NAM" id="P-25" state="BA" type="FAC">Sari Club</PLACE>. &quot;He
told me to take note, this is a place where white people gather, and
take note of the streets here,&quot; Junaedi testified.

The trial was adjourned until Thursday. Samudra and other key
suspects face death if convicted.
