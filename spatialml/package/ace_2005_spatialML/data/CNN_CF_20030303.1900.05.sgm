New Questions About Attacking <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-1" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>; Is Torturing Terrorists Necessary?

<TEXT>


 NOVAK 
Former <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:69085" id="Pl-3" latLong="34.750째N 92.500째W" state="AK" type="CIVIL">Arkansas</PLACE> Governor and <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> Senator Dale Bumpers has just published
a memoir called &quot;The Best Lawyer in a One-Lawyer Town.&quot; And it spans his
life from the depression era to the Clinton era. Let's ask him which was
more depressing.


 BEGALA 
First, thank you for writing this book. It is extraordinary. It is
wonderful. And then we read you one passage. You cite a session you had
with President Lyndon Johnson in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:30010462" id="Pl-4" state="TX" type="PPLA">Austin</PLACE>, I guess, at his <PLACE id="Pl-587" type="FAC">ranch</PLACE>, right?
Here is what you quote our President Johnson to you. &quot;When I was majority
leader, and later president, I spent all my time pulling every power
string I could find to pull, trying to pass bills that helped people.
That made their lives better and the country stronger. That's what the
Democrats stand for.&quot; &quot;Republicans? Republicans just stand for two
things: protecting the rich and investigation Democrats.&quot; That's true,
though, isn't it? Johnson was right, wasn't he?


 BUMPER 
I thought that was one of the most prescient things I ever heard, and
that was long before White Water.


 BEGALA 
Yes. He never heard of Ken Starr, but he anticipated it.


 BUMPERS 
Nothing ever changes, Paul.


 NOVAK 
Can I interrupt this Democratic picnic for just a minute? You know,
Senator, inadvertently, you gave support in this book to one of my pet
political themes, which you probably don't agree with. On page 256 you
say, &quot;As the years went by&quot; -- this is when you were in the Senate --
&quot;less and less information was new, fewer and fewer arguments were fresh,
and the repetitiveness of the old arguments became tiresome.&quot; &quot;I was
becoming almost as cynical as my constituents. I knew it was time to
leave.&quot; Isn't that a great argument for term limits? I know very few
senators or any who are as good in their third term as they are in their
first term. Shouldn't we limit them to two terms?


 BUMPERS 
First of all, that statement is not designed to cover everybody in the
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> Senate. But I must say, that's a pretty accurate statement.
But it has nothing do with term limits, in my opinion. I think term
limits is the worst idea I ever heard of.

(APPLAUSE)

 BEGALA 
Amen.


 NOVAK 
I tried at least.


 BEGALA 
Let me turn one more page, to page 257, actually, right next door to
where Bob was reading. This struck me because you've got the courage to
say something that is heretical today and it's music to my ears. You say,
&quot;Partisanship has taken on an odious connotation, and it may indeed be
shriller now than ever. But we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that we
have two political parties so people will have choices. If everybody
agreed on everything, it might be a tranquil society, but it surely would
be a dole one, and certainly not certainly a good one.&quot;


 BUMPERS 
You know, Paul, that's the reason we have two parties, so people have a
choice. And I've said many times, if we all agreed on everything,
everybody would want to marry Betty and we would really be in a mess,
wouldn't we, Bob?


 NOVAK 
Senator Bumpers, of the 22 senators of the old confederacy, when I got to
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-6" latLong="38.895째N 77.037째W" state="DC" type="PPL">Washington</PLACE> with the Associated Press, 45 years ago, 22 of them were
Democrats, nine were Republicans. Now 13 are Republicans and nine are
Democrats. And of the Democrats, I don't think there is a real liberal.
Your last year in the Senate I had an interview with you and I wrote a
column called &quot;The Last <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208921051" id="Pl-7" type="RGN">Southern</PLACE> Liberal.&quot;


 BUMPERS 
And I thank you. It was a very flattering article, Bob.


 NOVAK 
And you said, I'll quote it, you said, today's <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208921051" id="Pl-8" type="RGN">Southern</PLACE> voters are
&quot;children of Democrats who are not swayed by the same things their
mothers and fathers were. They certainly are susceptible to the
Republican message.&quot; That's a good future for the Democratic Party in the
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208921051" id="Pl-9" type="RGN">South</PLACE>.


 BUMPERS 
Bob, I think that the reason everybody in the south -- you know, first of
all, we were -- when Franklin Roosevelt was elected president, we had
been living what we thought was still a conquered nation after the Civil
War. And we felt that Franklin Roosevelt was the first person who ever
really acknowledged that the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208921051" id="Pl-10" type="RGN">South</PLACE> had peculiar problems. And from that
time on, that's the reason we had 22 Democratic senators from 11
confederate states, is because of the Civil War and because of what we
thought was a heavy hand of the federal government all the time. Of
course there was always that old story about the Yankees, and Yankees
were synonymous with Republicans. But that's all changed and memories
have dimmed. And people, you know, they don't remember that. And so the
message, the Republicans have actually had a golden opportunity to make
their case and they've done it successfully. And the Democrats need
desperately to get a message to counter that, and they need to get a
message and stay on it. I mean we cannot be all over the lot.

(CROSSTALK)

 NOVAK 
(UNINTELLIGIBLE) they're just not buying the new deal anymore in the
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208921051" id="Pl-11" type="RGN">South</PLACE>. Isn't that the truth?


 BUMPERS 
Well, that's true. They're not buying a new deal. But I'll tell you the
message the Democrats ought to be -- that every time we get sort of
within the grasp of the golden age, I mean within reach of the golden
age, where everybody has health care, where everybody gets a good
education -- you know I'm one of the million and a half people -- my
brother went to Harvard, I went to Northwestern University. Two schools
my father couldn't have even thought about affording. A million and a
half veterans came out of War World II on the GI bill and got that kind
of an education. If that makes me a liberal, because I believe the
government has a role to play in that, then I am a certified liberal,
because I think that made the <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-12" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> stronger. I think certainly it made
every one of those people stronger, and I think we ought to be doing it
right now. No child in this <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-13" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> ought to be deprived of an education
for lack of money. No elderly person ought to have to make a choice
between food and medicine. And they do it by the millions every day. And
now...

(APPLAUSE)

 BEGALA 
Will you run for president? I'll chair a committee. Dale Bumpers for
president, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much.


 BUMPERS 
Thank you, Paul.


 BEGALA 
That was just terrific. The book again is Dale Bumpers, &quot;The Best Lawyer
in a One-Lawyer Town.&quot; I highly recommend it. And next in our &quot;Fireback&quot;
segment, one of our viewers has a question about our president's concept
of democracy. Stay tuned.

(APPLAUSE)
