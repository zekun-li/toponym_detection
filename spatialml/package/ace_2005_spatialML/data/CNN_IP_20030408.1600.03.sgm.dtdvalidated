 WOODRUFF 
And, as we listened to John King's report, we can tell you that President
Bush has just -- his plane has just landed at <PLACE form="NAM" id="Pl-424" type="FAC">Andrews Air Force Base</PLACE>,
just <SIGNAL id="S-1">close to</SIGNAL> the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-1" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="US-DC" type="RGN">Washington</PLACE> area, the president having flown back to the
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> from that meeting in <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17395725" id="Pl-3" latLong="54.500°N 6.500°W" state="GB-NIR" type="CIVIL">Northern Ireland</PLACE> in <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17410393" id="Pl-4" latLong="54.583°N 5.933°W" state="GB-NIR" type="PPLA">Belfast</PLACE> with the
<PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-5" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> prime minister, Tony Blair. You just heard John reporting about
it. They primarily talked about the war in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-7" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, the aftermath of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-8" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>.
But they also discussed the <PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208667208" id="Pl-14" type="RGN">Middle East</PLACE> and, as well, getting the
<PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17395725" id="Pl-13" latLong="54.500°N 6.500°W" state="GB-NIR" type="CIVIL">Northern Ireland</PLACE> peace process started up again. It has been said that
Saddam Hussein ruled <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-9" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> with an iron fist. I guess you can say in the
past tense. His regime has left behind some disturbing evidence to
support those claims. The abandoned secret police <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-410" type="FAC">headquarters</PLACE> in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897821" id="Pl-15" latLong="30.494°N 47.819°E" state="IQ-BA" type="PPLA">Basra</PLACE>
is just one example. ITN's Bill Neely is with the Royal Marines and he
takes us on a tour of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897821" id="Pl-16" latLong="30.494°N 47.819°E" state="IQ-BA" type="PPLA">Basra</PLACE>'s <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-387" state="IQ-BA" type="FAC">chamber of horrors</PLACE>.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

 BILL NEELY, ITN REPORTER (voice-over) 
Saddam Hussein's <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-10" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> is a state of terror, and this is where it's
planned and perpetrated, the <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-407" type="FAC">headquarters</PLACE> of his secret police, this one
in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897821" id="Pl-17" latLong="30.494°N 47.819°E" state="IQ-BA" type="PPLA">Basra</PLACE>. No <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-6" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> soldier has been here yet. Today, as I walked in, I
met Iraqis, none of whom had ever been inside willingly. What was to
follow was a horrific education in terror and torture: in the smoking
<PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-411" type="FAC">basement</PLACE> of the bombed <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-389" type="FAC">building</PLACE>, a <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-412" type="FAC">warren</PLACE> of cells. Here, prisoners were
tortured.


 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
Yes, of course.


 NEELY 
People died.


 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
People died, people in prison without court, without trial.


 NEELY 
Any people who Saddam did not like.


 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
Of course. Of course.


 NEELY (voice-over) 
The <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-390" type="FAC">building</PLACE> is crumbling. Down we went, further to cells that had no
light, little air, cockroaches, filth, and, on the ground, a gas mask and
bottles of chemicals.


 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
You can imagine this every day, every month. So many people come here,
but we don't know about them at all.


 NEELY 
These ordinary Iraqis had been terrified to come here, until today,
though one student on the left had been here before.


 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
He was one of the prisoners here. (on camera): For how long?


 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
Eight years.


 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
Eight, nine, eight years.


 NEELY (voice-over) 
And his crime for eight years in jail? He prayed too much and was seen as
a dangerous radical. (on camera): More cells. (voice-over): But the
Mukhabarat <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-395" type="FAC">headquarters</PLACE> had more horrors to reveal.


 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
And they tied their hands behind and hung them and hung them for many
days.


 NEELY 
These men had relatives murdered here. So desperate are they to tell
their story that they began reenacting what they and their brothers and
friends have suffered. The hook in the ceiling is for one purpose only,
another hook in a different cell and a different form of torture. Saddam
Hussein controlled <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-11" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> through fear, torture and execution. And it
happened here to tens of thousands of Iraqis that Saddam's secret police
deemed dangerous. This man cowered for months, crammed with 300 mothers
into a huge cell. Hamid Fatil (ph) may look like he's acting, but he was
tortured here, along with his two brothers, who were executed. This man
was here, too, with his brother.


 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
They sentenced him to death. And they sent him to <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-19" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> and killed. He
was hanged there, hanged.


 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
There's a prisoner under the name of Ahmed Adis Aeid (ph).


 NEELY 
They kept records of prisoners, these and their fingerprints all that's
left of them, apart from the photographs they took of exactly what they
had done. (on camera): If there is an evil center to Saddam Hussein's
regime, then it is surely here and in other places of torture. And
there's plenty here that we simply cannot show you. In this <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-422" type="FAC">block</PLACE>, it was
men over here, hundreds of them, and women and children here.
(voice-over): To call all this a <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-403" type="FAC">chamber of horrors</PLACE> is a cliche. And this
<PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-402" type="FAC">place</PLACE> is beyond cliche. The hundreds or thousands who died here who were
given no trial, no voice, cry out. On the ground, I found a book called
&quot;The Psychology of Interrogation,&quot; as if the men who worked here for
Saddam needed a handbook. I was glad of the fresh air and glad to leave,
glad I could. No one knows yet whether the new <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-12" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> will be the kind of
place where these children can grow up free of the fear, the horror of
torture. Bill Neely, ITV News, <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897821" id="Pl-18" latLong="30.494°N 47.819°E" state="IQ-BA" type="PPLA">Basra</PLACE>.

 WOODRUFF 
Unspeakable. Journalists killed in the line of duty in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-20" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> -- how
neutral are reporters in a war supposed to be? Our Jeff Greenfield
examines that question when we come back.
