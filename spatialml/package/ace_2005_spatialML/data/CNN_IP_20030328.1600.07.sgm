 WOODRUFF 
We know that some of the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" predicative="true" state="US-DC" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> troops now fighting in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-3" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> are
longtime veterans of warfare, probably not most, but some. Their military
service goes back to the <PLACE country="VN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16266660" id="Pl-6" latLong="16.167°N 107.833°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Vietnam</PLACE> era. Others, though, are novices. So
what is it like for them to face combat far from home? For an idea, here
is CNN's Candy Crowley with some war stories. 

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

 CANDY CROWLEY, CNN SR. POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over) 
They are, we are told, well trained.


 SEN. CHUCK HAGEL (R), <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780792" id="Pl-7" latLong="41.500°N 99.750°W" state="US-NE" type="CIVIL">NEBRASKA</PLACE> 
This is a messy business. There's nothing very pretty about the training
that you take to prepare you for combat, because it is to kill people.


 CROWLEY 
In the spring of 1970, a squad of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> soldiers spotted a small unit of
Viet Cong that had been circling for days. Staff Sergeant Tom Ridge
opened fire. A Viet Cong soldier dropped dead. (on camera): Did you at
the time or have you since looked back and pondered on killing someone?


 TOM RIDGE, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY 
Mm-hmm.


 CROWLEY 
And what's that like?


 RIDGE 
That's one of those introspective times where it's just -- it's just an
introspective time, not a public time.


 CROWLEY (voice-over) 
Duke Cunningham was a <PLACE country="VN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16266660" id="Pl-10" latLong="16.167°N 107.833°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Vietnam</PLACE> fighter ace shooting down five enemy
planes. After his first, he returned to a ship deck full of sailors and
crew cheering, shaking his hand, pushing in to slap his back.


 REP. RANDY CUNNINGHAM (R), <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778" id="Pl-8" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="US-CA" type="CIVIL">CALIFORNIA</PLACE> 
And one of the guys looked at me and says: Duke, what's it like to kill
somebody? And, all of a sudden, bang, it just hit me. You don't think
about those things. And it's removed. It's far off. It's not in close.
And I went to the priest, because it bothered me. I knew I could do it
again. But I didn't know it was going to bother me as much as it did. And
it still does.


 CROWLEY 
Of all the wounds time does not heal, the ones that fester deep in the
soul are the wounds you inflict.


 RIDGE 
It's not something that civilized people do. You don't -- it's just not
-- it's not a matter of being tormented, but troubled in the sense that
that's not what we do, unless we're called upon to do it, under the most
extreme set of circumstances.


 CROWLEY 
War may sometimes be a necessary thing, but it can never be a natural
thing. Training bridges that gap. Sergeant Chuck Hagel was seriously
wounded twice in <PLACE country="VN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16266660" id="Pl-11" latLong="16.167°N 107.833°E" type="COUNTRY">Vietnam</PLACE>.


 HAGEL 
You are trying to kill people, because the alternative is, if you are in
combat, you will be killed. So your choices are not varied. It's very
simple. And so you do what you're trained to do. You do what you're there
to do. And, in <PLACE country="VN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16266660" id="Pl-12" latLong="16.167°N 107.833°E" type="COUNTRY">Vietnam</PLACE>, it was body count.


 CROWLEY 
Training is what keeps you running toward the front while trucks loaded
with dead bodies pass you, going the other way.


 REP. CHARLES RANGEL (D), <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780796" id="Pl-9" latLong="43.000°N 75.500°W" state="US-NY" type="CIVIL">NEW YORK</PLACE> 
It's hard to explain what training can do. Training sets your mind to
respond not to common sense and judgment, but to training. You really
don't have time to think: I'm going the wrong way. I should be going the
other way.


 CROWLEY 
Later, when he was wounded and trapped behind enemy lines in <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208826267" id="Pl-13" type="RGN">Korea</PLACE>, Staff
Sergeant Charlie Rangel led 40 men, fighting their way to safety. He won
a Bronze Star.


 RANGEL 
If you're killing people, it's out of fear, not really, in my opinion,
out of bravery. Nobody is looking for medals. Everyone wants to live
another day.


 CROWLEY 
Don't misunderstand. Rangel, Cunningham, Ridge and Hagel are all proud,
decorated combat veterans. It's just, a decade later, killing still
troubles the soul. Maybe that's a good thing. (on camera): Did you do it
again?


 CUNNINGHAM 
I did. I shot down four more MiGs. And I often told myself -- I said
that, if I ever get used to this, I shouldn't be here.


 CROWLEY (voice-over) 
Candy Crowley, CNN, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-14" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="US-DC" type="PPLC">Washington</PLACE>.

 WOODRUFF 
Remarkable interviews and a reminder that what these men and women are
going through right now in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, they will remember for the rest of their
lives. That's our coverage this hour.
