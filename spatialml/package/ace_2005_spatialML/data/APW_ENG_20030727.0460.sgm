<PLACE country="GT" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18864178" id="Pl-2" latLong="15.500°N 90.250°W" type="COUNTRY">Guatemala</PLACE>'s human rights prosecutor asked journalists on Sunday to
provide evidence and promised to pursue justice in the wake of
violent demonstrations in the <PLACE country="GT" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:18866794" id="Pl-6" latLong="14.621°N 90.527°W" state="GU" type="PPLC">capital</PLACE>'s commercial core.

Club-wielding rioters smashed windows, burned parked cars, chased and
beat reporters and blocked traffic here Thursday, vowing to remain
until courts allowed former dictator Gen. Efrain Rios Montt to
register as a candidate for the Nov. 9 presidential election.

Police did little to prevent the violence, but protesters quickly
left Friday after Rios Montt asked them to halt demonstrations.

A constitutional prohibition on former coup leaders kept Rios Montt
out of two previous presidential runs. But this year, the <PLACE country="GT" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:18864178" id="Pl-7" latLong="15.500°N 90.250°W" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>'s
highest tribunal, the Court of Constitutionality, approved his
candidacy.

In a judicial standoff, the Supreme Court has blocked the candidacy.

The <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> State Department said Friday the party of Rios Montt
provided <PLACE id="Pl-41" type="FAC">tents</PLACE> and other materials to supporters who were responsible
for widespread violence.

``We are going to do everything within our reach so that justice is
done,'' <PLACE country="GT" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18864178" id="Pl-3" latLong="15.500°N 90.250°W" type="COUNTRY">Guatemalan</PLACE> Human Rights Prosecutor Sergio Morales said
Sunday.

Over the weekend, businesses reopened and life appeared to return to
normal in the <PLACE country="GT" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:18866794" id="Pl-8" latLong="14.621°N 90.527°W" state="GU" type="PPLC">capital</PLACE>.

But Morales said he feared Rios Montt's political sympathizers could
return to the <PLACE id="Pl-42" type="FAC">streets</PLACE> with even greater violence.

A spokesman for the Collective Organization of Civil Societies said
the group is asking an election tribunal to suspend Rios Montt's
<PLACE country="GT" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18866794" id="Pl-4" latLong="15.500°N 90.250°W" type="COUNTRY">Guatemalan</PLACE> Republican Front party, which controls the presidency and
enjoys a majority in Congress.

The group said it also is asking the court not to recognize
candidates for public office who participated in the demonstration
Thursday.
