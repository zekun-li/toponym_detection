Suicide bombing at <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-12" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Israeli</PLACE> shopping mall; fifth attack in two days



<PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19202908" id="Pl-3" latLong="31.767°N 35.233°E" state="JM" type="PPLC">JERUSALEM</PLACE> (AP)

A suicide bomber detonated explosives at the entrance to a crowded
mall in northern <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-13" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" mod="N" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> on Monday, killing at least four shoppers and
wounding 20 in the fifth such attack in two days.

The spate of bombings underscored how difficult it will be to carry
out the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE>-backed ``road map'' plan, a three-stage prescription for
ending violence immediately and setting up a <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-36" predicative="true" type="RGN">Palestinian</PLACE> state by
2005.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Monday's attack at
the <PLACE continent="AI" country="IL" form="NAM" id="P-62" state="JM" type="FAC">Shaarei Amakim mall</PLACE> in the working class town of <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" id="Pl-46" state="JM">Afula</PLACE>, which has
been targeted repeatedly by <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-37" predicative="true" type="RGN">Palestinian</PLACE> militants because of its
proximity to the <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208669530" id="Pl-28" state="WE" type="RGN">West Bank</PLACE>.

The Islamic militant group Hamas carried out four bombings over the
weekend.

The <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" id="Pl-47" predicative="true" state="JM">Afula</PLACE> explosion  _	the 95th in 32 months of fighting  _  went
off at 5:14 p.m. (1414 gmt) at the entrance to the mall, reportedly
as shoppers were waiting in line for a security check. Malls and
other public places have significantly stepped up security since the
outbreak of <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-14" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Israeli</PLACE>-<PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-38" predicative="true" type="RGN">Palestinian</PLACE> fighting in September 2000.

The explosion killed the attacker and four shoppers, police said.
Twenty people were wounded, including several who were in serious
condition.

Earlier Monday, a 19-year-old <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-39" predicative="true" type="RGN">Palestinian</PLACE> riding a bicycle detonated
a 30-kilo (66-pound) bomb near a military <PLACE continent="AI" country="PS" form="NOM" id="P-63" state="GZ" type="VEHICLE">jeep</PLACE> in the <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19202844" id="Pl-49" latLong="31.417°N 34.333°E" state="GZ" type="RGN">Gaza Strip</PLACE>,
injuring three soldiers.

In response the spate of bombings, <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-15" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> threatened to boycott
foreign envoys who meet with Yasser Arafat. <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-16" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> holds the
<PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-40" predicative="true" type="RGN">Palestinian</PLACE> leader responsible for the latest violence, even though
the recent attacks were carried out by Islamic militants.

Hamas said Monday it has no intention of halting attacks, despite
<PLACE country="EG" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19706664" id="Pl-51" latLong="27.000°N 30.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Egypt</PLACE>'s efforts to have <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-41" predicative="true" type="RGN">Palestinian</PLACE> militant groups agree to a
one-year suspension of shootings and bombings. In a renewed mediation
attempt, <PLACE country="EG" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19706664" id="Pl-52" latLong="27.000°N 30.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Egyptian</PLACE> envoys have been holding meetings in <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19202844" id="Pl-50" latLong="31.417°N 34.333°E" state="GZ" type="RGN">Gaza</PLACE> and
<PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17458740" id="Pl-53" latLong="33.500°N 36.300°E" state="DI" type="PPLC">Damascus</PLACE> in recent days with leaders of the militant groups. The
armed groups say they might agree to a truce if <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-17" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> promises to
stop hunting militants	_  a proposal <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-18" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Israeli</PLACE> Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon has turned down.

A Hamas leader, Abdel Aziz Rantisi, said Monday that ``legitimate
resistance will continue as long as occupation exists on our holy
<PLACE country="PS" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-54" type="RGN">land</PLACE>.''

Asked whether Hamas was challenging Abbas, Rantisi said only that
there was no point in trying to negotiate with Sharon, whom he called
a ``terrorist.''

<PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-19" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> said there will be no letup in its campaign against those
involved in violence. <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-20" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> ``will continue to fight terror
everywhere, at any time and in any way possible,'' a Cabinet
statement said Sunday, after a Hamas suicide bomber killed seven
Israelis on a <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19202908" id="Pl-4" latLong="31.767°N 35.233°E" state="JM" type="PPLC">Jerusalem</PLACE> bus earlier in the day.

The ministers also decided to cold-shoulder foreign envoys who meet
with Arafat. ``Whoever wants to visit Arafat can visit Arafat but he
won't be allowed to meet senior <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-21" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Israeli</PLACE> officials,'' said a senior
Sharon adviser, Raanan Gissin. <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-22" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> first threatened such a boycott
several weeks ago, but enforced it only selectively.

The European Union on Monday dismissed the decision and a spokeswoman
said EU leaders will continue to involve Arafat in the search for
peace.

Arafat, who has been confined by <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-23" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> to the <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208669530" id="Pl-29" state="WE" type="RGN">West Bank</PLACE> town of
<PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" id="Pl-55" state="WB" type="PPL">Ramallah</PLACE> for more than a year, accused <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-24" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> of inciting against
him.

``Not to forget I condemned it completely, these terrorist
activities,'' Arafat said Monday in halting English, speaking before
the <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" id="Pl-48" state="JM">Afula</PLACE> bombing.

``At the same time, you should remember (<PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-25" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE>'s) incitement policy
against me. This is to increase the siege around me. Where did it
happen that a president was forbidden from moving out of his
office?''

The new <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-42" predicative="true" type="RGN">Palestinian</PLACE> prime minister, Mahmoud Abbas, has denounced
violence against Israelis, but also told Sharon in a weekend meeting 
_  the first <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-26" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Israeli</PLACE>-<PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-43" predicative="true" type="RGN">Palestinian</PLACE> summit in three years	_ that he
wants to persuade the militants to stop attacks, rather than disarm
them by force.

The argument over how rein in the militants and halt violence has
been holding up implementation of the road map. The plan calls for
parallel steps in the first stage, including a <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-44" type="RGN">Palestinian</PLACE> crackdown
on militants, an <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-27" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Israeli</PLACE> troop pullback from <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-45" predicative="true" type="RGN">Palestinian</PLACE> towns and a
construction freeze in Jewish settlements.

Sharon insists the Palestinians make the first move. He was to have
discussed his objections with <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> President George W. Bush this
week, but canceled his trip after Sunday's bus bombing. The
Palestinians have accepted the plan as is.

The latest wave of attacks began Saturday evening when a Hamas bomber
blew himself up in a square in the <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208669530" id="Pl-30" state="WE" type="RGN">West Bank</PLACE> city of <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19206903" id="Pl-31" latLong="31.533°N 35.100°E" state="WE" type="PPL">Hebron</PLACE>, killing
an <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-7" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Israeli</PLACE> settler and his pregnant wife. On Sunday morning, another
Hamas assailant blew up the <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19202908" id="Pl-5" latLong="31.767°N 35.233°E" predicative="true" state="JM" type="PPLC">Jerusalem</PLACE> bus and about half an hour
later, a third bomber from the group detonated explosives on the
outskirts of <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19202908" id="Pl-6" latLong="31.767°N 35.233°E" state="JM" type="PPLC">Jerusalem</PLACE>, killing only himself.

<PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-8" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Israeli</PLACE> analyst Mark Heller said that ``Hamas is trying to ensure
that the road map doesn't go anywhere and that Abu Mazen (Abbas)
doesn't go anywhere either.''

The three bombers came from <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19206903" id="Pl-33" latLong="31.533°N 35.100°E" state="WE" type="PPL">Hebron</PLACE> and at one point studied at the
Polytechnic Institute in the <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19206903" id="Pl-56" latLong="31.533°N 35.100°E" state="WE" type="PPL">city</PLACE>. Two bombers, Fuad Qawasmeh, 18,
and Bassem Takrouri, 19, lived in the same <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19206903" id="Pl-34" latLong="31.533°N 35.100°E" predicative="true" state="WE" type="PPL">Hebron</PLACE> <PLACE country="PS" gazref="IGDB:19206903" id="Pl-35" state="WE" type="RGN">neighborhood</PLACE> and
were friends. The <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-9" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Israeli</PLACE> military on Monday demolished the Qawasmeh
family home, part of a policy of trying to deter attacks by punishing
assailants' relatives.

The three bombers released farewell videos, apparently taken in the
same wooded area. In frame grabs published in the Yediot Ahronot
daily, the three struck identical poses, holding up assault rifles.
Each wore a green headband with Quranic verses and an olive-colored
vest with pockets for ammunition and grenades.

In another development, <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-10" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Israeli</PLACE> forensics experts identified a body
that washed up on a <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19218455" id="Pl-57" latLong="32.067°N 34.767°E" predicative="true" state="TA" type="PPL">Tel Aviv</PLACE> <PLACE country="IL" form="NOM" id="Pl-58" state="TA" type="RGN">beach</PLACE> last week as that of a Briton,
Omar Khan Sharif, 27, the suspected accomplice of a <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-60" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> suicide
bomber who blew himself up outside a <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19218455" id="Pl-59" latLong="32.067°N 34.767°E" predicative="true" state="TA" type="PPL">Tel Aviv</PLACE> pub April 30. Two
musicians and a waitress were killed in the blast.

Sharif also carried explosives, but they didn't go off, and he fled.
It was not known whether he was hurt at the time. The identification
was made with the help of DNA samples supplied to <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-11" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE>'s Forensics

Yehuda Hiss. He said Sharif drowned.   pvs-kl
