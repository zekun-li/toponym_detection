murdering his wife Laci and their unborn son, and he now faces the
death penalty.  There's been a lot of media coverage of the Peterson

Nice to meet you, too.


 Ken 
Thank you. Have yo- how so, how do you feel about this Scott Peterson
trial and all the publicity they're putting into it, and


 Paul 
Well, I -- I think it -- gets so much publicity because this -- this guy
came out and -- claimed his wife was missing


 Ken 
Right.


 Paul 
and then, uh,  his double life came came into view, and I I think that
was


 Ken 
Right.


 Paul 
kind of fascinating,


 Ken 
Uh, with the with the girlfriend?


 Paul 
for -- Yeah.


 Ken 
Okay.


 Paul 
For a lot of folks.


 Ken 
Okay, I guess I can agree with that, also, um, yeah.


 Paul 
I mean, he's he's not really a celebrity like ~OJ was, or


 Ken 
Yeah, well, I that's what I was g- my next question was, that was
another big criminal criminal, uh, trial,


 Paul 
or -- Yeah.


 Ken 
you know, and they -- that went on for months and months and months
and then, I guess the next one that we'll be getting is the Michael
Jackson thing.


 Paul 
Yeah, Michael Jackson and and Robert Blake,


 Ken 
Yeah, Robert Blake, Robert Blake.


 Paul 
and, uh


 Ken 
He's out right now, isn't he, or is still in jail?


 Paul 
I'm I'm not sure.


 Ken 
Well, huh, eh, eh, I think, uh, one of those guys Columbo, Columbo,
that's Robert Blake, right?


 Paul 
Uh, Baretta.


 Ken 
Oh, that's Baretta. He's he's in jail.


 Paul 
Baretta.  Yeah.


 Ken 
I don't know. These guys, I don't know.


 Paul 
Robert Blake doesn't seem like he's all there.


 Ken 
Yeah, well.


 Paul 
I I don't know what's going to happen in that one.


 Ken 
But he needs that parakeet with him or something.  Remember the
parakeet in the show? Yeah, I


 Paul 
That's right.  I forgot about that.  Yeah.


 Ken 
uh, Gilligan's <PLACE comment="imaginary" form="NAM" id="Pl-3" type="RGN">Island</PLACE>, all this good stuff.


 Paul 
Right.  ((Right.)) -- Yeah.


 Ken 
I mean, it was great stuff.


 Paul 
Baretta.  They -- Baretta had a really good theme song, too.


 Ken 
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I like that song. I like that song, yeah. But with
this Peterson guy -- he looks so cool and reserved but, uh, it's like
nothing's phasing him, and


 Paul 
I know. Even when they


 Ken 
Do you think he did it?


 Paul 
when they read the verdict he he didn't even flinch, didn't even
blink.


 Ken 
No.  Uh, do you think he did it?


 Paul 
I went, wow, that's kind of weird.


 Ken 
Yeah.


 Paul 
Well, i- it makes me think that he probably did it.


 Ken 
Eh, he, eh, w- it seemed like he covered his tracks, though, I mean,
they have no evidence other than the bodies that they found.


 Paul 
Yeah.


 Ken 
So, it's crazy, but,  they're saying where they're going to put him th
eh, in the same prison next to Charles Manson or something like that.
That's, like, really crazy.  Yeah, so they can be buddies or
something, I don't know.


 Paul 
((But))


 Ken 
But I don't think he's going to last in jail if he goes to jail, I
mean. They talking abou- -- how do you feel about this death penalty
thing?


 Paul 
Well,  jeez, I I don't know.


 Ken 
Eh, I mean, I don't thin- I mean, I I I don't think that he should
suffer that, you know, I think he should, um,  I don't think that he
should suffer that.


 Paul 
Yeah.  Well, if if he does live and he is in prison,


 Ken 
Mhm.


 Paul 
he'll probably get some wacky woman -- who wants to marry him,


 Ken 
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah, that


 Paul 
get married two or three times in there.


 Ken 
Yeah, that reminds me of the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:947252" id="Pl-5" latLong="40.782°N 73.966°W" state="NY" type="RGN">Central Park</PLACE>, uh, guy Robert Chambers in
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-4" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL">New York City</PLACE>. Now,


 Paul 
Yeah.


 Ken 
they've -- I'm surprised they haven't made a big, big -- thing out of it,
eh, he just got busted last week for some -- something.  And, um,  I
think he s- m- was meeting women in the jail like that, too, when he
was there, but he just got out of doing fifteen years and,  you know,
he was just, eh, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:947252" id="Pl-6" latLong="40.782°N 73.966°W" state="NY" type="RGN">Central Park</PLACE>, he had, uh,  well, rough sex or
something, with a woman in the park and they said he strangled her, or


 Paul 
Oh, sure, the preppy guy.


 Ken 
Yeah, the preppy guy, yeah.  They caught him last weekend doing
something, but,  uh, he driving without a license or whatever.


 Paul 
Yeah, just always always in trouble now.
