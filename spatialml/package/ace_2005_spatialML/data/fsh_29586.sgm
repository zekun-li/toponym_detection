10. Death of Arafat (2) PLO leader PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a
<PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18543072" id="Pl-1" latLong="48.867°N 2.333°E" predicative="true" state="FR-75" type="PPLC">Paris</PLACE> <PLACE country="FR" form="NOM" id="Pl-62" type="FAC">hospital</PLACE> last week, after a lot of controversy surrounding his
illness and death.  What do you think caused his illness, and could it
have been something malicious (like poisoning)?  What do you think of
<PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-2" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE>'s policies surrounding Arafat's illness and death?  Should
President Bush or a senior <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> official have attended Arafat's funeral?
Should <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725" id="Pl-3" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> have let Arafat be buried in <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19202908" id="Pl-4" latLong="31.767°N 35.233°E" state="IL-JM" type="PPL">Jerusalem</PLACE>?


 Paul 
Hi, I'm Paul. I'm in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780781" id="Pl-7" latLong="39.000°N 75.500°W" state="US-DE" type="CIVIL">Delaware</PLACE>.


 Mike 
Hi, this is Mike. I'm in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778" id="Pl-8" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="US-CA" type="CIVIL">California</PLACE>.


 Paul 
Nice to meet you, Mike.


 Mike 
Yeah, nice to meet you.


 Paul 
Uh,  well,  pretty complicated -- topic.


 Mike 
Yeah, interesting issue.  I don't know. What do you think? You think
it was poison?


 Paul 
Well -- ((smoosh)) no, I I heard that just a couple of days ago and -- I I
kind of doubt it or at least I hope not. I guess that's what it is.


 Mike 
Yeah, I don't think he was poisoned.  I think he was just fr- frail
and I think he'd been uh, he'd been looking frail and he was shaky.


 Paul 
Yeah.


 Mike 
You know, he'd been looking h- like he was shaking and, uh,  seeming
frail.  For some time when I'd see him in public, uh,


 Paul 
Yeah, that's true.


 Mike 
presentation -- so forth.


 Paul 
Right.


 Mike 
And I think it whatever it was, it got him, just caught up with him
and and he reached the you know, the end of his time.


 Paul 
Yeah.


 Mike 
So,  that's about it on that, I guess.


 Paul 
Yeah.  Well, I I guess now that that he's he's died -- it'll be, uh,  or
it it should be a change for the ~PLO


 Mike 
Well, yeah, it'll be change. I I don't know if it'll move forward any
better -- but, uh, this, uh,  I've heard our administration thinks it
will. I think he was a block to the peace -- but I think it's not only
his doing, it's also the -- you know, the, uh, more, uh, drastic
elements of the ~PLO that, uh,  that, uh, wouldn't allow him to pursue
peace


 Paul 
Right.


 Mike 
at any cost.


 Paul 
Well, I'm -- I'm -- I don't know, uh.  He he seems like a guy who is much
more comfortable -- being under siege than in negotiating peace
settlements.


 Mike 
Uh-huh.


 Paul 
Um, I


 Mike 
Yeah.


 Paul 
maybe that


 Mike 
Well, you know, he was kind of damned if he did and damned if he
didn't.


 Paul 
Yeah.  Well


 Mike 
You know, if he if he made peace he had factions of his own people
that would've killed him -- and if he didn't make peace, eh, then he's
considered, you know, the the warmongering, uh, man who won't make
peace, you know.  So, he, uh, he couldn't really win. I don't think he
could make peace.  I don't know if anyone else can, either.


 Paul 
Yeah, I guess that's the big question, if someone moderate takes over
and they reach a settlement,  does that mean the ~PLO will split?  I
mean that -- that could be just -- dangerous.


 Mike 
Yeah.


 Paul 
I guess, uh, making peace with half of the Palestinians is better than
nothing.


 Mike 
One of the other questions it asked us was, did we think our president
and our, uh, you know, officials should've attended his funeral.


 Paul 
((Oh, I b-))


 Mike 
What do you think about that?


 Paul 
Yeah.  Well, I I don't remember who they sent, but they did send over
some very -- low level state department person


 Mike 
Oh, I see.


 Paul 
and, uh,


 Mike 
I didn't know that.


 Paul 
I I -- I was kind of embarrassed about that.


 Mike 
That we did or d- that we did not send our officials.


 Paul 
I mean -- We -- we did,  but i- it was some -- it was a nobody, basically.


 Mike 
So you were embarrassed because you thought they should've sent
someone higher up?


 Paul 
Yeah.


 Mike 
Oh, I see.


 Paul 
I I -- I mean, for for the funeral ceremony in,  uh, <PLACE country="EG" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19706664" id="Pl-9" latLong="27.000°N 30.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Egypt</PLACE>.  ((I mean))


 Mike 
Yeah, I think so, too. I think they should've sent someone higher up.


 Paul 
And, uh, I I can understand that they wouldn't want to send anybody


 Mike 
((that he)) -- Don't forget this was the this was the representative of
a whole people, you know what I mean?


 Paul 
Yeah.


 Mike 
The past he was their main representative and, uh, just out of respect
for the people we should've sent someone I think.


 Paul 
Hm.  Bad bad or good.  Yeah, I think it would've been a much more
positive message.


 Mike 
Yeah.


 Paul 
((We realized that))


 Mike 
I think it would've, uh, you know, been a -- a step toward, um, you
know, gaining the, uh,  I don't know, the respect and and the, um,


 Paul 
Right.  Yeah, I think that


 Mike 
uh, th- of the people that we're going to have to be working with to
try to bring about a peace, you know.


 Paul 
that ((yeah,)) it -- Yeah.


 Mike 
And, uh,  it would've -- gone an- a little farther to encourage them to,
you know, be willing to sit down at the table with us, at least, you
know.


 Paul 
That's true.


 Mike 
And, I mean not that it would've even been noticed -- in that regard had
he -- had had our president or someone higher gone, but the fact that
they didn't, that's what's really going to be noticed, you know what I
mean?


 Paul 
Yeah.  Well, uh, you know,  Colin Powell is a -- pretty moderate guy and
would've been nice to see him there or maybe -- the, uh,  Deputy -- Secret
of State.


 Mike 
Uh-huh.


 Paul 
I'm not even sure who that is.  Eh,  somebody will -- or higher up.


 Mike 
Yeah, someone m- a little more, uh


 Paul 
Some flunky bureaucrat.


 Mike 
yeah.  Yeah, it didn't seem quite appropriate.


 Paul 
But, uh, at at least for the ceremony in <PLACE country="EG" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19706664" id="Pl-10" latLong="27.000°N 30.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Egypt</PLACE> I think, uh,  I can
understand that no one would want to go into -- <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-6" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Palestinian</PLACE> territory. I
mean,  they it was total chaos there.


 Mike 
Uh-huh.  Sure.  Yeah.
