An old friend, Joseph Britt of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:316387 IGDB:317387" id="Pl-5" latLong="34.023°N 84.616°W" state="GA" type="PPL">Kennesaw</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1705317 IGDB:1706317" id="Pl-6" latLong="32.750°N 83.500°W" state="GA" type="CIVIL">GA</PLACE>, recently emailed to ask
about anti-immigration as an issue for <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779803 IGDB:1780803" id="Pl-2" latLong="37.500°N 78.500°W" state="VA" type="CIVIL">Virginia</PLACE> Democrats. Joe had just
read a George W. Grayson article in the William &amp; Mary Alumni Magazine ,
&quot; Myths About Illegal Immigration .&quot;

Grayson does not cite any <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779803 IGDB:1780803" id="Pl-3" latLong="37.500°N 78.500°W" state="VA" type="CIVIL">Virginia</PLACE> examples, but among the &quot;myths&quot; he
attempts to explode are that illegal immigrants perform jobs Americans
don't want and that they contribute more in taxes and social security
than they take from government programs.

I personally know a good number of immigrants, both legal and
illegal. One fellow, a Brazilian, has done everything by the book. He
gets rewarded by having to pay an immigration attorney thousands of
dollars while getting yanked around by the Immigration Service... not to
mention, he's paying the government thousands in taxes. He gets very
frustrated because many of his contemporaries work for cash under the
table. They aren't paying lawyers, and they pay nothing into the system.
Of course, the Americans who employ illegal immigrants are happy to pay
in cash because it means cheaper labor for them.

Who benefits? The illegal immigrants themselves, of course. The
employers who hire them instead of raising wages to attract native-born
Americans and legal immigrants. And families who hire cheap domestic
labor, whether to clean the house, wash the laundry or maintain the
lawn. Who loses? Poor, native-born Americans who otherwise would be paid
higher wages for their manual labor. Legal immigrants like my <PLACE country="BR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19368722 NGA:-631278" id="Pl-4" latLong="10.000°S 55.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Brazilian</PLACE>
friend, who sometimes feels like a sap for playing by the rules. And the
rest of us who won't hire anyone to work for us unless they're paying
their taxes, even if it means we pay more.

Yeah, I've got a problem with turning around and giving illegal
immigrants all the rights and privileges of the native born and the
legal immigrants who've played by the rules. Yes, I do.
