Oh, well, there- there're been people that have been -- I don't know
if you've been watching Sixty Minutes, there was a story of this lady
that was -- her -- -- she's a, um,  uh, what do you call it, um,  uh,
reservist


 Tom 
Uh-huh.


 Joe 
and she did her time back in the sixties and she's like fifty
something years old now. And they're going to call her to go.


 Tom 
You got to be -- -- huh.  My goodness.


 Joe 
Yeah.  Yeah, they don't -- they don't have, um -- see what happened
with the, um,  the volunteer army,  they're not getting enough people,
so they're thinking of maybe get- putting in a draft.


 Tom 
Ah.  Eh, she was ar- she was already -- in the service -- and they're
calling her back in?


 Joe 
Was in the service, she- -- yep, she did her time. She thought -- she's

 Tom 
Oh, oh, she's still in the service.

some people that don't want to go.


 Tom

 Joe 
You know,  so,  but it's- it's kind of a scary thing and I don't know
if the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-23" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> is doing the right thing. I don't know, to tell
you the truth.


 Tom

 Joe 
<PLACE country="KW" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-789772 IGDB:19210228" id="Pl-24" latLong="29.500°N 47.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Kuwait</PLACE>.

 Tom 
Okay, he wants to make sure everything's done over there before he
comes back.


 Joe 
Yeah, he wants to finish the job that his father

there was going to be -- look at all these insurgents. Look at what
happened a couple days ago, they killed, um,  like seventy people.
They -- put a bomb right into where the -- the, uh,
