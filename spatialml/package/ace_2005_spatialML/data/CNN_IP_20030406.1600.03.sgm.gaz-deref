It is another friendly fire disaster. This morning, an <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> bomb
destroyed a convoy carrying high officials of the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:20032588 NGA:32588" id="Pl-20" latLong="36.288°N 42.174°E" predicative="true" type="PPL">Kurdish</PLACE> Peshmerga
forces, which have been fighting alongside the Americans on the northern
front. At least 17 <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:20032588 NGA:32588" id="Pl-21" latLong="36.288°N 42.174°E" predicative="true" type="PPL">Kurdish</PLACE> commanders and their guards were killed, along
with an interpreter working for the BBC. More than 40 were injured. The
military chief of the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:20032588 NGA:32588" id="Pl-22" latLong="36.288°N 42.174°E" predicative="true" type="PPL">Kurdish</PLACE> KDP, the brother of their leader, Massud
Barzani (ph), was gravely hurt. (on camera): Trying to organize a
northern front with just a few hundred <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-13" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> Special Forces troops and the
poorly armed <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:20032588 NGA:32588" id="Pl-16" latLong="36.288°N 42.174°E" predicative="true" type="PPL">Kurdish</PLACE> Peshmerga guerrillas was always going to be a
high-risk exercise. The idea was to open the way with heavy sustained
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-10" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> bombing of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> positions. But today, it all went disastrously
wrong. (voice-over): Even as we filmed the wreckage, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-14" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> jets were still
dropping their bombs nearby. Giant explosions erupted down the <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-25" type="ROAD">road</PLACE>.
Earlier, we had joined another convoy of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-15" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> Special Forces troops and

the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> army. At first, all was calm. <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-11" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> troops controlled the
operation from a rooftop. Then, as the Kurds advanced again, the Iraqis
opened up. (on camera): Now we're hearing the boom of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> guns as they
fire towards our positions. All morning, the Kurds have been trying to
advance, and that was the shell going off. (voice-over): The <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-7" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE>

We finally managed to get out by car. Here in the north, <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-8" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> tanks and
guns are still firing, and the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-12" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> effort is looking a little
ragged. Julian Manyon, ITV News, on the northern front.
