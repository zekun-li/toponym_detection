We'll get to that story in a moment. But first, we're going to go to
outside <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17039439" id="Pl-2" latLong="55.752°N 37.616°E" state="MOS" type="PPLC">Moscow</PLACE>, to our correspondent Jill Dougherty, who is covering
explosions at a rock concert -- Jill.


 JILL DOUGHERTY, CNN <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17039439" id="Pl-3" latLong="55.752°N 37.616°E" state="MOS" type="PPLC">MOSCOW</PLACE> BUREAU CHIEF 
Yes. You know, we're just down the <PLACE country="RU" form="NOM" id="Pl-37" type="FAC">street</PLACE> from where that happened. It's
right outside a big air <PLACE country="RU" form="NOM" id="Pl-38" type="FAC">base</PLACE> called <PLACE country="RU" form="NOM" id="Pl-39" type="FAC">Tushino</PLACE>, where a concert, a rock
concert called Wings was taking place. There were about 20,000 people
inside that <PLACE country="RU" form="NOM" id="Pl-43" type="FAC">stadium</PLACE>. And luckily, if you can say it's lucky, the two
explosions took place outside of the <PLACE country="RU" form="NOM" id="Pl-44" type="FAC">stadium</PLACE>, apparently at the <PLACE continent="AI" country="RU" form="NOM" id="P-51" state="MOS" type="FAC">entrance</PLACE>.
In fact, we're just close to that entrance a few minutes ago, where two
female suicide bombers tried to get into the <PLACE country="RU" form="NOM" id="Pl-45" type="FAC">stadium</PLACE>. That is the latest
information that we have. It went up toward the gate. We're not allowed
to go in. And one woman exploded whatever she had, the type of
explosives, destroying herself and killing reportedly three people at
that point. And then about 15 minutes later, the other explosion by the
other woman at another gate. You can still see, in fact, and I was down
there as I said just a minute ago, you can still see two bodies lying on
the <PLACE country="RU" form="NOM" id="Pl-49" type="FAC">street</PLACE>, and police are obviously taking forensic evidence and trying
to figure out precisely how it happened, but I could say that it would
appear to fit that scenario of having the two females suicide bombers.
The people who were inside the <PLACE country="RU" form="NOM" id="Pl-46" type="FAC">stadium</PLACE> really did not know what was going
on. But outside the <PLACE country="RU" form="NOM" id="Pl-47" type="FAC">stadium</PLACE>, the latest reports, 18 people killed, and
many wounded, although we don't have a final figure on that. The latest
was 20, but the numbers have been increasing. Back to you.


 DAVIS 
Jill, have there been any claims of responsibility, Jill?


 DOUGHERTY 
Not that we have heard, although you would have to say that this really
does have the fingerprint of <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17103517" id="Pl-5" latLong="43.300°N 45.700°E" state="CE" type="CIVIL">Chechen</PLACE> terrorists. After all, just in the
past month or so, we have had a couple of incidents in <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17103517" id="Pl-6" latLong="43.300°N 45.700°E" state="CE" type="CIVIL">Chechnya</PLACE> and the
region in the south of <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-10" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" mod="S" type="COUNTRY">Russia</PLACE> of females suicide bombers with explosives
strapped to their waist, blowing themselves up, and killing people
besides. So this would appear to fit that description. And also, police
are saying that they found the passport of one of the women, a girl, 20
years old, who does have a name that is <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17103517" id="Pl-7" latLong="43.300°N 45.700°E" state="CE" type="CIVIL">Chechen</PLACE>.


 STARR 
Now, Jill, has Vladimir Putin given any indication yet, even though it's
very early on, of any further security crackdowns? Do the <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-11" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Russian</PLACE> people
support his moves on the security issues against the Chechens?


 DOUGHERTY 
Well, if they're cracking down on security in <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17039439" id="Pl-4" latLong="55.752°N 37.616°E" state="MOS" type="PPLC">Moscow</PLACE>, you would have to
say that people do support that by and large, because they're scared. You
know, they're worried. Remember last October, you had the <PLACE country="RU" form="NOM" id="Pl-48" predicative="true" type="FAC">theater</PLACE> hostage
crisis, and people want security. Now, if you're talking about the
crackdowns in <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17103517" id="Pl-8" latLong="43.300°N 45.700°E" state="CE" type="CIVIL">Chechnya</PLACE>, there you have to say that it's kind of a mixed
bag. Many people think they ought to simply get rid of the terrorists, do
whatever they can and get tough, but there are other people who believe
that it's precisely that type of get tough and round them up type of
approach that's spurring on the violence and -- by the Chechens. But
you'd have to say, also, that and it is fair to say that there is an
element of international terrorism, as well. It is not just, you know,
rebels in <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17103517" id="Pl-9" latLong="43.300°N 45.700°E" state="CE" type="CIVIL">Chechnya</PLACE> wanting to be free. There is also an element of
international terrorism involved.
