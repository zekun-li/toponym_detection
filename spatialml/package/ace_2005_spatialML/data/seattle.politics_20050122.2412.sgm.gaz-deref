Did you miss the inaugural address ?

 Re: Did you miss the inaugural address ? 

    

The administration's approach to history is at odds with what has been
described by a communications adviser to the president as the
&quot;reality-based community.&quot; A dumb phrase, but not a dumb thought: He
meant that the administration sees history as dynamic and changeable,
not static and impervious to redirection or improvement. That is the
Bush administration way, and it happens to be realistic: History is
dynamic and changeable. On the other hand, some things are constant,
such as human imperfection, injustice, misery and bad government.

This world is not heaven.

The president's speech seemed rather heavenish. It was a God-drenched
speech. This president, who has been accused of giving too much
attention to religious imagery and religious thought, has not let the
criticism enter him. God was invoked relentlessly. &quot;The Author of
Liberty.&quot;&quot;God moves and chooses as He wills. We have confidence because
freedom is the permanent hope of mankind . . . the longing of the soul.&quot;

    

Ending tyranny in the world? Well that's an ambition, and if you're
going to have an ambition it might as well be a big one. But this
declaration, which is not wrong by any means, seemed to me to land
somewhere between dreamy and disturbing. Tyranny is a very bad thing and
quite wicked, but one doesn't expect we're going to eradicate it any
time soon. Again, this is not heaven, it's earth.

    

This is--how else to put it?--over the top. It is the kind of sentence
that makes you wonder if this White House did not, in the preparation
period, have a case of what I have called in the past &quot;mission
inebriation.&quot; A sense that there are few legitimate boundaries to the
desires born in the goodness of their good hearts.

One wonders if they shouldn't ease up, calm down, breathe deep, get
more securely grounded. The most moving speeches summon us to the cause
of what is actually possible. Perfection in the life of man on earth is
not.

god drenched? he's in good company.

read lincoln's rather short 2nd inaugural

it's about as &quot;god drenched' as you could get. way more so than bush's
(god, He, the Lord, etc.) over and over and over again. considering the
brevity of the speech, you could barely fit any more &quot;god's&quot; and such in the
address without buying vowels and consonants from vanna at a 5 fer 1 speshul
price.

carry on, peggy

To put it simply (for your benefit): Lincoln spoke *of* God,
demonstrating the irony of a war fought between people with more
similarities (their religious beliefs among them) than differences.
Dubya spoke *for* God, demanding that we should all fall in line behind
him, because he's got The Plan, and God's On His Side. Pure religious
jingoism.

My favorite part of the speech, though, is this line:

    

You have to admire the sheer audacity of doublespeak like that.
Especially when the list of the 'willing' just went into the circular
file a few days ago.

Bush's inaugural is an announcement that the Bush Doctrine was as much a
sales pitch as the WMD justification; BushCo hasn't abandoned the neocon
ideal of a Pax Americana. And you, mr. whit, fell for it.

bull

and he has made the point repeatedly in interview after interview that he
has never claimed to speak for god, nor has he claimed that this is &quot;god's
war&quot;

it's a bunch of histrionic rubbish

and complete evasion from the fact tht lincoln's (wonderful) second
inaugural was much more &quot;god drenched&quot; than bush's

    

no. i accept the fact that it's not a bad thing that bush mentioned god.

read the text of bush's 2nd inaugural

read lincoln's

they are both great speeches.

peggy noonan is full of it

I guess it's a matter of personal taste. Some people like Barry
Manilow. It seems to me Bush is getting a bit pie-eyed and mystical.
He's carrying out God's destiny to liberate mankind, and trusting in
God to deliver a favorable outcome for a just cause. That is a fine
sounding theory, but the results of Bush's policies look worse every
day.
