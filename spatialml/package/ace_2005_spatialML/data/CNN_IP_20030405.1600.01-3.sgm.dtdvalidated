Tim

It was a discovery that horrified the soldiers who made it. The remains
of hundreds of men were found in plastic bags and Unsealed hard-board
coffins. <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-8" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> troops found the bodies at an abandoned <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> military
<PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-113" type="FAC">base</PLACE> on the outskirts of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16887301" id="Pl-10" latLong="31.183°N 46.117°E" mod="BORDER" state="IQ-DQ">Azubayr</PLACE>. The evidence suggested it was the scene
of appalling atrocities. The teeth in many of the skulls had been broken,
and bones appeared to be wrapped in strips of military uniform. It's not
clear how long the bodies had lain here, but they were clearly not from
this war.


 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
You come to expect everything in war fighting. The coffins were there. It
was a bit more of a surprise when I discovered the bags with the human
remains inside.

Inside a neighboring <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-104" type="FAC">building</PLACE>, there was evidence of cells and a catalog
of photographs of the dead. Most had died from gunshot wounds to the
head. Others were mutilated beyond recognition, their faces burned and
swollen. Outside, soldiers discovered what they described as a purpose-
built shooting <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-105" type="FAC">gallery</PLACE>, the brickwork behind it riddled with bullets.
Identity cards revealed the names of some of the dead. Forensic
specialists will now visit the scene and hope to establish the truth of
what happened here and when. (on camera): Today's discovery seems to
provide shocking evidence of atrocities under Saddam Hussein's regime.
Most people are afraid to talk openly about what's been happening here.
But when they do, <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-9" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> soldiers believe, more horrors will come to
light. Tim Ewart, ITV News, <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16887301" id="Pl-11" latLong="31.183°N 46.117°E" state="IQ-DQ">Azubayr</PLACE>.
