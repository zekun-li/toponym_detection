The story that refuses to end

MCI has repoened their merger talks with Qwest . I still don't know
where this deal will end up -- as I said a while ago, Verizon raised
their bid, but for now the disparity between the two is so high that
it's hard to justify the board's decision (particularly, for those of
you in the Verizon-is-more-stable camp, because someone who feels that
way can sell the MCI stock they get and buy Verizon, cancelling out that
particular negative consequence at a minimal cost).

Actually, I'm beginning to feel that way as well. And I've been in
the Verizon/MCI camp for quite awhile here.

It's more than just disparity between the two deals, however. It
really becomes how much premium should one pay for these assets coming
out of bankrupcy.

As the bidding gets higher the risk of the deal actually working
increases. Qwest is playing a very risky game here, but from a position
of desparation. Verizon could absorb a deal that didn't totally work
out, but why should they take risk by paying more for it? They might see
themselves five years from now buying the COMBINED entity for less.

For investors at this point, I'd just take the money and run. Or as
you say, take the money and just buy Verizon with it (I'd think about
doing a pairs trade on this one).

My sense is that Qwest will win because they feel they have no other
choice-- and can get the financing. Then we will see whether they can
skirt bankruptcy themselves...
