 CALLER 
Mr. President, please accept my comments on your wonderful presidency. I
have been working with General John T. Chain and General Larry D. Welch
to save the B-2 bomber. You recently made a visit to <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1653769" id="Pl-3" latLong="34.579°N 118.116°W" state="CA" type="PPL">Palmdale</PLACE> to see it.
Please give us your comments and whatever you can to boost it.


 REAGAN 
Well, I think very highly of it, of course. And I...


 KING 
Didn't Cheney just...


 REAGAN 
And I put it back into use after it had been grounded. And I think that
this -- things of this kind reflect our great technology, our
technological superiority over so many potential enemies.


 KING 
You disagree with cuts then?


 REAGAN 
But what?


 KING 
You disagree with cuts in it?


 REAGAN 
Well, yes, although I understand that with all the over spending that's
done and the national deficit, the only place where the Congress ever
seems to show had a desire to cut is in military. When I took office, I
found that on any given day 50 percent of our military aircraft couldn't
fly for lack of spare parts. Now this is just disgraceful. And as I say,
that's the only place where they seem to want to cut. Every budget that I
submitted they put on the shelf and said it was dead on arrival. Then
they would send back to me a continuing resolution, which was their form
of budget. Every time my budget was far lower than the money they wanted
to spend.


 KING 
We're hop scotching in lots of places. Are you surprised Gorbachev has
hung on this long?


 REAGAN 
Well, yes, because, you know, that vested aristocracy there, all of those
Politburo members and so forth, they're frightened that a change in the
system is going to take away their perquisites, just as he closed down
their private stores where they could go in without waiting on line and
they could choose from any one of a half a dozen meats, where the <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-4" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Russian</PLACE>
citizens had to stand hours in line and there would only be one kind of
meat when they did get in the store.


 KING 
Did you like him right away?


 REAGAN 
I'll tell you, there was something. Because having known previous leaders
-- there were three before he came along. They kept dying on me. And in
our first meeting, as we came together with my team and his team, I had
told our people what I was going to do. And that was, as we started to
sit down, I said to him, why don't you and I let our teams start this
discussion and you and I go out and get some fresh air? He was out of his
chair before I finished the sentence. So we walked down to the edge of
the lake, where there was a kind of a house there, a bath house, that
belonged to the building where we were together. And we went in, and we
had a little conversation. We had to have interpreters, but we had a
little conversation between us. And...


 KING 
You liked him right away?


 REAGAN 
Yes, and I told him, for example, that -- we were there. I said, we don't
mistrust each other because we're armed -- this is a quote of someone
else -- we're armed because we mistrust each other. So in addition to
talking about reducing the weaponry and so forth, why don't we see if we
can reduce the causes of mistrust. And I said, the only thing left to us
otherwise is to go back to an arms race, and then I made my declaration.
I looked him right in the eye and I said, &quot;and that's a race you can't
win. There is no way we're going to allow you to maintain a superiority
in weapons over us.&quot;
