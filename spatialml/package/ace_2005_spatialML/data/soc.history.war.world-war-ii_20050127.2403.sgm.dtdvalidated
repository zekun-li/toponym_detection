I hear discussion along the lines that the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-61" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> was *wanting* to go
to war with <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-18" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE>, and had been trying to bring that about for years.

Any recognized books that develop this thesis; is there a definitive work?

I've read quite a few more rational works describing how the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> was
doing its best to avoid, or at the very least postpone, a war against
<PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-20" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE>, mainly because FDR was trying to provoke Hitler to war and
didn't need a distraction on another distant front.

    

work?

(stuff deleted)

The thesis has been expounded by several conspiracy theorists, mainly
the ones who expounded that FDR knew <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:364230" id="Pl-62" latLong="21.355°N 157.972°W" state="US-HI" type="WATER">Pearl Harbor</PLACE> was about to be
attacked, and let it happen. One of their &quot;proofs&quot; was that the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>
carriers were out of port during the attack, and &quot;everybody knew&quot;
carriers were the capital ship of the future.

However, the two carriers operating out of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:364230" id="Pl-63" latLong="21.355°N 157.972°W" state="US-HI" type="WATER">Pearl</PLACE> at the moment were
sent West with light escort, on possibly intersecting routes with the
IJN Kido Butai, which had far more carriers and a far heavier escort.
Even stranger, the USS Enterprise was scheduled to be at <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:364230" id="Pl-64" latLong="21.355°N 157.972°W" state="US-HI" type="WATER">Pearl</PLACE> by Dec
6th, but got delayed by a storm.

Consequently, for the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:364230" id="Pl-65" latLong="21.355°N 157.972°W" state="US-HI" type="WATER">PH</PLACE> conspiracy theorists to believe that FDR kept
the carriers out of harm's way, we not only have to grant FDR the full
knowledge of Kido Butai's route of approach would not result in either
USN carrier fleet getting caught in a hopeless battle, but that FDR
could psychically manipulate the weather to prevent Halsey from sailing
into <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:364230" id="Pl-66" latLong="21.355°N 157.972°W" state="US-HI" type="WATER">Pearl</PLACE> and thus be ambushed.

To make a very long story short, it is foolish to assume that the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-7" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>
wanted to go to war against <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-21" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE> prior to 1941, considering the weight
of evidence arguing against a <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> desire for war, and the overwhelming
lack of evidence (not to mention rational thought) arguing for a <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>
desire for war.

Here's something I wrote as part of a larger article, some while ago:

Wasn't <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-23" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE> just defending herself when she attacked the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-10" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>?

This line of reasoning seems to derive from arguments that <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-24" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE> was being
&quot;driven into a corner&quot; by sanctions, and had no choice but to attack
the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-11" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>. Meiji <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-25" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE> was driven to emulate what it thought the <PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208561573" id="Pl-67" type="RGN">West</PLACE> was
doing in every facet of society. They had observed, for example, that the
<PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208561573" id="Pl-68" type="RGN">West</PLACE> was able to carve up <PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18099327" id="Pl-56" latLong="35.000°N 105.000°E" type="COUNTRY">China</PLACE> into &quot;Spheres of Influence&quot;, and was able
to do from great distances, while they, the Japanese, had had limited
success in their previous attempts to dominate the <PLACE form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:208826267" id="Pl-69" type="RGN">Korean peninsula</PLACE>,
much less <PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18099327" id="Pl-57" latLong="35.000°N 105.000°E" type="COUNTRY">China</PLACE>. As part of the catch-up effort, she whole-heartedly
entered into the Imperialist game in <PLACE continent="AI" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:30009613" id="Pl-70" type="CONTINENT">Asia</PLACE>, being treated as an equal
(relative to her power) by the other powers. However, after World War
I, <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-26" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE> failed to recognize a fundamental shift in the attitudes of her
former Imperial partners; they began a long, slow process of disengaging
themselves from their former Imperial areas, from their colonies, in
addition to outright stopping all expansions. <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-27" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE> chose to read this
as a sign that the <PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208561573" id="Pl-71" type="RGN">West</PLACE> had lost its power and resolve, and that <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-28" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE>
was the rightful heir to Imperial mantle in <PLACE continent="AI" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:30009613" id="Pl-72" type="CONTINENT">Asia</PLACE>. With the deaths of
many of the idealistic leaders who had led <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-29" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE>'s rise to international
prominence, and the refusal of the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-12" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> to intervene in <PLACE continent="AI" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:30009613" id="Pl-73" predicative="true" type="CONTINENT">Asian</PLACE> affairs,
in addition to the Bolshevik revolution and the stripping of possessions
from <PLACE country="DE" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18224345" id="Pl-74" latLong="51.500°N 10.500°E" type="COUNTRY">Germany</PLACE>, <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-75" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Britain</PLACE> found herself alone in dealing with an increasingly
aggressive <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-30" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE> in the area. Having a keen grasp of the obvious, she
began a policy of acceding to <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-31" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Japanese</PLACE> hegemony in the area.

<PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-32" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE> continued a policy of acquiring territory for some grand, illusive
scheme of a &quot;Greater Asia&quot;, subordinate and grateful to <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-33" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE>. The
reality of this was that only a single possession, <PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18082116" id="Pl-76" latLong="49.600°N 117.433°E" type="PPL">Manchuria</PLACE>, was
profitable to the Japanese, and the rest of the Empire turned out to
be a drain. This drain was greatly accelerated by <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-34" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE>'s invasion of
<PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18099327" id="Pl-58" latLong="35.000°N 105.000°E" type="COUNTRY">China</PLACE> proper in 1936. It was a war that <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-35" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE> assumed would be ended
in &quot;3 to 6 months&quot;; at the time of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:364230" id="Pl-77" latLong="21.355°N 157.972°W" state="US-HI" type="WATER">Pearl Harbor</PLACE>, it had been going on
for 5 years, at the cost of over half a million <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-36" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Japanese</PLACE> lives. The
war put a tremendous strain on <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-37" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE> (and was in fact opposed by more
radically NATIONALISTIC elements, as taking away from the development
of <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-38" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE>'s other possessions, particularly in the areas of scrap metal
and fuel.) Domestic consumption fell, consumer goods became scarce,
and the use of materiale for war purposes ate into <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-39" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE>'s domestic
industry. This cut further into her foreign reserves, exacerbating the
economic impact of the war. The war effort took on a life of its own,
however, and common sense was subordinated to it. <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-40" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE> expanded into
areas of <PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18099327" id="Pl-59" latLong="35.000°N 105.000°E" type="COUNTRY">China</PLACE> and <PLACE continent="AI" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16283867" id="Pl-78" type="RGN">Indochina</PLACE> which had no strategic value to her, but put
her in a position to threaten <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-79" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> and <PLACE country="NL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17850115" id="Pl-80" latLong="52.500°N 5.750°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Dutch</PLACE> possessions in the area;
possessions that both those Allied nations needed in order to continue
their fight against Hitler. At this point, the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-13" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> stopped ignoring the
<PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-41" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Japanese</PLACE> threat, and imposed a series of escalating sanctions on <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-42" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE>,
cutting off her scrap metal, limitting and then cutting off her oil
(<PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-43" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE> imported most of both from the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-14" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>.) While <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-44" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Japanese</PLACE> officials
realized that they had enough of each resource for <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-45" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE> to do well IF
THE WAR IN <PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18099327" id="Pl-60" latLong="35.000°N 105.000°E" type="COUNTRY">CHINA</PLACE> STOPPED, they were powerless over the military they
were supposed to control. An abortive attack on Soviet positions in
<PLACE country="MN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17648464" id="Pl-81" latLong="46.000°N 105.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Mongolia</PLACE> had placed <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-46" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE>'s focus firmly south, towards the possessions
of the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-15" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>' future allies. For no reason anyone could articulate, <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-47" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE>
felt she had to continue the war in <PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18099327" id="Pl-52" latLong="35.000°N 105.000°E" type="COUNTRY">China</PLACE>. To continue the war in <PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18099327" id="Pl-53" latLong="35.000°N 105.000°E" type="COUNTRY">China</PLACE>,
she had to have resources of oil and metal. To have these resources,
she must seize them, if others refused to sell them. In order to seize
them, she felt she had to attack and destroy the naval power of the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-16" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>.

Thus, for a &quot;3 to 6 month&quot; operation in <PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18099327" id="Pl-54" latLong="35.000°N 105.000°E" type="COUNTRY">China</PLACE> in 1937, <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-48" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE> would embark
on a war that would strip her of all the possessions and industries
she had acquired in 70 years. she must seize them, if others refused
to sell them. In order to seize them, she felt she had to attack and
destroy the naval power of the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-17" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>.

Thus, for a &quot;3 to 6 month&quot; operation in <PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18099327" id="Pl-55" latLong="35.000°N 105.000°E" type="COUNTRY">China</PLACE> in 1937, <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-49" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE> would embark
