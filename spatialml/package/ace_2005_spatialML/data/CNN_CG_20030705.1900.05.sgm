Joining us now from <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17398111" id="Pl-1" latLong="51.500°N 0.117°W" state="ENG" type="PPLC">London</PLACE>, Mr. Christopher Meyer, who was <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-2" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE>
ambassador to <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-22" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="DC" type="PPL">Washington</PLACE> for six years and now is chairman of the
independent watchdog authority that oversees the <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-3" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> press. Thank you
very much for coming in, Christopher.


 CHRISTOPHER MEYER, FORMER <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-4" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">BRITISH</PLACE> AMBASSADOR TO THE <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-23" type="COUNTRY">UNITED STATES</PLACE> 
It's great to be here, great to be here. Nice to see you all.

 O'BEIRNE 
There was a great deal of criticism here, Mr. Ambassador, that the BBC in
particular's recent coverage was slanted anti-<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-21" type="COUNTRY">America</PLACE> and antiwar. How
difficult did that make it for the Blair government to make its case to
the <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-5" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> public in the face of such hostile media?


 MEYER 
Well, it all depends on your point of view. I mean, if I were a BBC
representative, I would be telling you that my coverage of the war was
entirely impartial. There has been a lot of hoo-hah and fisticuffs over
the last two or three weeks between Number 10 Downing Street and the BBC
about the coverage of the war. Some of this has calmed down a bit now.
But we've been having fun and games in the last two or three weeks. But
if you're saying to me, Has that been, in effect, a serious obstacle to
the government getting over its message, I have to say, and I'm no longer
representing the <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-6" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> government, I have to say I don't think that is
the case. I think people here have understood pretty well what the issues
were, what the issues are, what they're going to be, because I think
they're going to be in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-15" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> for a long time to come. People may not agree
with the government always, but on the whole, people do understand what
is going on. And I've been traveling all around the <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-7" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">U.K.</PLACE> in the last
three months, and that is the message I've heard from people I've been
speaking to.

Sir Christopher, Tony Blair and George Bush were together on <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-16" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, but if
the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-24" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> were to seek support for another military action now,
say in <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-30" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE> or <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-28" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iran</PLACE> or <PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-26" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Syria</PLACE>, could <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-32" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="DC" type="PPL">Washington</PLACE> assume there'd be
<PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-8" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> support?


 MEYER 
I don't think <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-33" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="DC" type="PPL">Washington</PLACE> should ever assume anything. We know -- we have
this phrase in <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17404382" id="Pl-14" latLong="53.000°N 2.000°W" state="ENG" type="CIVIL">English</PLACE> English, I don't know whether you have it in
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-19" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> English, you know, horses for courses. We judge these cases case
by case. I think the likelihood of armed conflict against <PLACE country="SY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17451884" id="Pl-27" latLong="35.000°N 38.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Syria</PLACE> or <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-29" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iran</PLACE>
or <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-31" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE> to be extremely remote, and I don't think this eventuality
will arise. I think the issue of 9/11, the Taliban, al Qaeda,
<PLACE country="AF" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16632074" id="Pl-34" latLong="33.000°N 65.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Afghanistan</PLACE>, and now <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-17" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> were very special, and the justification for
them very precise. I had no qualms myself about our going to war in those
two cases. But I think the notion of taking on <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-36" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iran</PLACE>, say, before we've
even finished <PLACE country="AF" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16632074" id="Pl-35" latLong="33.000°N 65.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Afghanistan</PLACE>, still less <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-18" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, is absolutely fanciful, and I
don't think this case will arise.


 SHIELDS 
Mr. Ambassador, as an Irish American who's never been accused of being an
uncritical fan of all things <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-9" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE>, I do stand in some admiration of
the fact that your royals serve in the military, and, in fact, that the
mortality rate among the <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-10" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> upper class and royalty in both world
wars was higher than among the working classes. How do you explain that
sort of commitment? And what is apparently evaporated to a considerable
degree here in the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-25" type="COUNTRY">States</PLACE>?


 MEYER 
Well, I -- you know, one of the things that I have never been able to do,
and I regret it, is serve in our armed forces. I have been one of those
who have benefited from the sacrifices of our parents and our
grandparents. And my own father was a pilot in the Second World War, and
was killed in action. But the tradition was always that officers lead
from the front. They set an example to their men. And that is one of the
enduring traditions of the <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-12" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> armed forces and of the <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-11" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> army.
And so particularly in the First World War, which, as you know, was a
hideously bloody thing, I think the <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-13" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> army suffered in one day of
fighting on the <PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18528832" id="Pl-37" latLong="47.117°N 2.217°E" state="80" type="PPL">Somme</PLACE> the totality of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-20" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> casualties in <PLACE country="VN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16266660" id="Pl-38" latLong="16.167°N 107.833°E" type="COUNTRY">Vietnam</PLACE>. And
so the attrition rate was absolutely huge. But we haven't lost this, and
I don't think you have lost it either, to be perfectly frank.


 SHIELDS 
OK. Thank you so much for being with us, Sir Christopher Meyer, in
celebrating our own Independence Day. THE GANG will be back with the
&quot;Outrages of the Week.&quot;
