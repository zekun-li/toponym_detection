Former Senator Chuck Robb hasn't been heard from lately. Parade
magazine reminds us today that he's a co-chair of the Commission on the
Intelligence Capabilities of the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> Regarding Weapons of Mass
Destruction. They will report on March 31. I suspect Rob will speak out
after that date, although much of the Committee's report will be
classified.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:30126100" id="Pl-2" latLong="37.500°N 78.500°W" state="US-VA" type="CIVIL">Virginia</PLACE> is blessed to have so many respected foreign policy and
security policy public servants, past and present.

Good old Chuck Robb...I assume everyone on here has seen &quot;The Perfect
Candidate&quot;? Quite a treat.
