for some perspective, let's turn to miles o'brien with retired air
force general don shepperd.


thank you very much. if you are going to fight on the ground, you have
to encounter bridges somewhere along the way. a lot of bridges between
where the 3 7 cavalry and the rest of the u.s. forces are now and
their ultimate destination, downtown <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">baghdad</PLACE>. we have the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-10" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE> laid
out for you here. how many bridges in this <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-11" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE> alone?


in this map we have right here, 13 major bridges in downtown <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-3" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">baghdad</PLACE>,
including the expressway <PLACE id="Pl-81" type="FAC">bridge</PLACE> over here. three bridges here
attaching east <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" mod="E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">baghdad</PLACE> to west <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" mod="W" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">baghdad</PLACE> and the <PLACE id="Pl-83" type="FAC">palace</PLACE> area.


this is one technique, one possible way <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-12" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">u.s.</PLACE> forces might seize a
bridge, a bridge that might be defended by iraqis. let's look at the
animation. typical scenario there. it doesn't really matter for this
scenario that we're laying out here. this would be representing m1-a1
tanks coming towards the bridge firing.


you have to bundle up and line up to go across that bridge. makes it
vulnerable to fire from the other side.


potentially chemical weapons, too.


as we turn the other direction, what you'll see are these <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-9" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">iraqi</PLACE> tanks
that are kind of fortified there. they have burns in front of them.
artillery behind them firing back. and then they there goes the smoke
screen. the idea of the smoke screen is to obscure the oncoming forces
fire ing at you from being able to see.


it doesn't work, though.


it works both ways. it obscures you but also obscures them.


here's an f-16. he comes in and wants to identify his target and he's
got a big --


can't see through the smoke. we've got some techniques we're going to
show you.


somewhere near we can put down special
