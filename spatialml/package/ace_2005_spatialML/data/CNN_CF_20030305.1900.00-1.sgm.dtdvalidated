Look at Latest Evidence Against <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-1" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>; Any Hope U.N., Old Europe will 
Come Around to Bush Administration's Way of Thinking?




 PAUL BEGALA, CNN CO-HOST 
Hello, everybody. Welcome to CROSSFIRE. On this Ash Wednesday, the pope
asks Catholics to fast for peace and he asks President Bush to work for
peace, while the White House sends out Colin Powell to make yet another
case for war. We will debate all of that as well as &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;'s
latest, stunning revelations about Michael Jackson. Believe it or not, we
got new news on Michael Jackson. Do you think he really looks like a
mummy? Certainly not a daddy. But first, our own little moonwalk across
the political landscape, the &quot;CROSSFIRE Political Alert.&quot; The foreign
ministers of <PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18572019" id="Pl-10" latLong="46.000°N 2.000°E" type="COUNTRY">France</PLACE>, <PLACE country="DE" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18224345" id="Pl-13" latLong="51.500°N 10.500°E" type="COUNTRY">Germany</PLACE> and <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-16" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Russia</PLACE> today issued a joint declaration
that they will not allow a second <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE>-backed resolution to pass the
United Nations Security Council. President Bush wants the Security
Council to explicitly authorize force against <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, and his press
secretary today remained optimistic that in the end, that's just what
he'll get. President Bush is said to be focusing on one fence-sitting
Security Council member, the <PLACE continent="AF" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:30002777" id="Pl-17" predicative="true" type="CONTINENT">African</PLACE> nation of <PLACE country="GN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18819617" id="Pl-18" latLong="11.000°N 10.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Guinea</PLACE>, because he said --
quote -- &quot;I used to have one of their pigs.&quot; So -- OK, I made that up. He
didn't say that.


 TUCKER CARLSON, CNN CO-HOST 
Well, I suspected that. You know...


 BEGALA 
But they are a swing vote. <PLACE country="GN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18819617" id="Pl-19" latLong="11.000°N 10.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Guinea</PLACE> is an important swing vote.


 CARLSON 
As is <PLACE country="CM" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16852455" id="Pl-20" latLong="6.000°N 12.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Cameroon</PLACE>. <PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18572019" id="Pl-11" latLong="46.000°N 2.000°E" type="COUNTRY">France</PLACE> and <PLACE country="DE" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18224345" id="Pl-14" latLong="51.500°N 10.500°E" type="COUNTRY">Germany</PLACE> are pointing to inspection and saying,
Look, they're working. We don't need war. They're not pointing out that
inspections are working only because there's the credible threat of war.
Saddam wouldn't be destroying missiles unless he thought he was going to
be destroyed if he didn't.


 BEGALA 
I think that's a good point. It doesn't mean we have to go to war. But I
think President Bush should get credit for pushing to instructions and
backing them up with the threat of force.


 CARLSON 
It means when you take the threat of force of the table, you're likely to
stop disarming Saddam Hussein.


 BEGALA 
Yes, I'm not saying take the threat of force. I'm saying we don't need to
use force right now.


 CARLSON 
Well, <PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18572019" id="Pl-12" latLong="46.000°N 2.000°E" type="COUNTRY">France</PLACE> and <PLACE country="DE" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18224345" id="Pl-15" latLong="51.500°N 10.500°E" type="COUNTRY">Germany</PLACE> would like to. Secretary of State Colin Powell
today responded to Saddam Hussein's latest attempts to fool the world.
Powell called <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-3" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> steps toward disarmament -- quote -- &quot;too little, too
late&quot; gestures, meant to split international resolve to force <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-22" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> to
give up its weapons of mass destruction. <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-21" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> intelligence said Powell
indicates <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> has hidden equipment to produce al-Samoud 2 missiles, even
as it destroys existing ones, missiles that until recently, it claimed
not to have. Powell also revealed that <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> is hiding chemical and
biological weapons in poor neighborhoods around <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-23" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>. In order to
secure peace, Powell concluded, the international community must confront
Saddam Hussein's refusal to disarm -- quote -- &quot;here and now.&quot; So, there
you have it. The essence of the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> case for war against Saddam
Hussein. The only question left: who do you believe? Secretary of State
Colin Powell or <PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18572019" id="Pl-9" latLong="46.000°N 2.000°E" type="COUNTRY">France</PLACE>?


 BEGALA 
No, the question is...


 CARLSON 
That is the question.


 BEGALA 
Who do you believe: the Bush administration or your lying eyes? We are
watching them destroy weapons, as the president says, Oh, that's just a
hoax.


 CARLSON 
But Paul...


 BEGALA 
They are disarming.


 CARLSON 
No, no, no that's not what the president's saying. He's saying, the --
it's a hoax to the extent that those are only a small number of the
weapons there. Keep in mind, these are weapons that Saddam Hussein, until
recently, said he didn't even have. He's a liar.


 BEGALA 
Of course.


 CARLSON 
And to trust Saddam Hussein in effort to disarm him -- foolish task,
don't you think?


 BEGALA 
Absolutely. Nobody trusts Saddam Hussein. The question is, Is he a
sufficient threat to <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-7" type="COUNTRY">America</PLACE> today to risk the lives of our young men and
women.


 CARLSON 
That's a separate question. That's a very separate question.


 BEGALA 
I think he's not. I think the inspections can work.


 CARLSON 
That's a different argument. We can take it up later.
