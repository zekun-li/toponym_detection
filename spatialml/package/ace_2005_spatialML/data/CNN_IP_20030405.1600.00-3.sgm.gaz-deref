They're well within striking distance of the mortars and rockets of the

stick with this however messy it gets. (voice-over): Drastic action is
need to convince a dubious population.

Get down, get down!


 BREMNER 
We watched a nighttime raid on the homes of Ba'ath Party officials and
Fedayeen militia. These are men singled out by locals and believed by
army intelligence to be behind much of the brutality and corruption. Most
are not accused of specific crimes but suspected of being part of the
state-sponsored climate of fear.

The party's influence extends to every corner of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-3" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> society. In two
small communities, we witnessed more than 70 people being rounded up.
Some are clearly terrified of what lies ahead, uncertain of their fate,
overcome by nerves. But as it ended, there was no <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-2610495 IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-14" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> apology for the
scale of the operation.


 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
We came in firm, we came in fair. There was no shots fired. We gave a
good warning before we came in. We've been playing warnings to people to
stay in their houses, and we've only lifted those people we've got very
good intelligence on.


 BREMNER 
This is not a tactic that can be regularly repeated, or the <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-2610495 IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-15" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> risk
being accused of installing their own rule of terror. Despite the
discomfort of a few, there's a conviction that this is a night's work
that will benefit the majority. Juliet Bremner in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897821 NGA:-3102179" id="Pl-11" latLong="30.494°N 47.819°E" state="IQ-BA" type="PPLA">Basra</PLACE>.
