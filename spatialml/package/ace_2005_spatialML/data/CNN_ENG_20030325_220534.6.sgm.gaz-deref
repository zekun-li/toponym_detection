on we go in the meantime. again, today, there were
disturbing hints, and we underscore hints here, that
coalition forces may soon face an attack using chemical
weapons. yesterday the story centered on intelligence
regarding enemy intentions. today the evidence is somewhat
more tangible. reporting for us, cnn's david ensor.


reporter: the evidence is accumulating that <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-7" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">iraq</PLACE> may be
planning to use chemical weapons. gas masks turning up in
abandoned trenches. in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3102880 IGDB:16897120" id="Pl-8" latLong="31.054°N 46.259°E" state="IQ-DQ" type="PPL">nasiriyah</PLACE> in a <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-92" state="IQ-DQ" type="FAC">building</PLACE> marked as a
hospital <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">u.s.</PLACE> marines found weapons, atropine antidote
kits, and that was not all.


they found over 3,000 chemical suits and gas masks as well
as a number of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">iraqi</PLACE> military uniforms.


reporter: the findings are heightening concerns among
coalition forces approaching <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-14" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">baghdad</PLACE> since, as the iraqis
should know, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" predicative="true" state="IQ-DQ" type="COUNTRY">u.s.</PLACE> and <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-2610495 IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-9" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">british</PLACE> forces do not use chemical
weapons. <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">u.s.</PLACE> officials say some intelligence indicates a
red line may have been drawn around the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-10" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">capital</PLACE> with
republican guard units ordered to use chemical weapons once
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">u.s.</PLACE> and allied troops cross it. there is also
intelligence, officials say, suggesting republican guard
units have been issued artillery shells containing chemical
agents.


there has been intelligence scraps, who knows how accurate
they are, chatter in the system, that suggests that the
closer that coalition forces get to <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-11" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">baghdad</PLACE> and <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16888105 NGA:-3111895" id="Pl-15" latLong="34.597°N 43.677°E" state="IQ-SD" type="PPL">tikrit</PLACE> the
greater the likelihood and that some command and control
arrangements have been put in place.


reporter: in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-12" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">baghdad</PLACE> deputy prime minister tariq aziz
repeated his government's stand -- it does not have any
kind of weapons of mass destruction.


translator: when they started to talk about the weapons of
mass destruction, we know and we always knew that that was
fabrication and lines.


reporter: experts say saddam hussein's forces will likely
try to hold out in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">baghdad</PLACE> for as long as possible without
using the weapons his government insists it does not have,
hoping to build international pressure on the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" type="COUNTRY">u.s.</PLACE> and
