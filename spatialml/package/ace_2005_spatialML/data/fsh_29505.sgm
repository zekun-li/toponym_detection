9. Elections Did you vote in the recent <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> Presidential election?
What did you think of the two candidates, George Bush and John Kerry?
What about the Vice Presidential candidates, Dick Cheney and John
Edwards?  What issues were most important to you in deciding who to
vote for?  If you didn't vote, why not?


 Lynn 
Hi, my name is Lynn.


 Dave 
Hi, my name's Dave.


 Lynn 
Oh, how are you?


 Dave 
Pretty good.


 Lynn 
Oh, so the topic is elections.


 Dave 
Right.


 Lynn 
Um, I did vote


 Dave 
I did also.


 Lynn 
and I voted for, uh,  not Bush.


 Dave 
Well, I guess, uh, you voted for Kerry then, right.


 Lynn 
Yes, I did.


 Dave 
Yeah, are you in a blue or a red state?


 Lynn 
I'm sorry?


 Dave 
A blue or a red state?


 Lynn 
I'm from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780791" id="Pl-3" latLong="38.250°N 92.500°W" state="MO" type="CIVIL">Missouri</PLACE> -- I'm in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780791" id="Pl-4" latLong="38.250°N 92.500°W" state="MO" type="CIVIL">Missouri</PLACE>.


 Dave 
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780791" id="Pl-5" latLong="38.250°N 92.500°W" state="MO" type="CIVIL">Missouri</PLACE>.


 Lynn 
Mhm.


 Dave 
I forget which is which.


 Lynn 
Well I b- really don't even look at it like that, but I should know
that, shouldn't I?


 Dave 
Yeah, I'm in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:449508" id="Pl-6" latLong="40.000°N 86.250°W" state="IN" type="CIVIL">Indiana</PLACE> -- so, uh,


 Lynn 
And we were kind of split in the middle I think so I don't know.
Maybe we're half blue and half red.


 Dave 
Yeah.


 Lynn 
So, you voted for Bush, then?


 Dave 
No, I I voted for Kerry.


 Lynn 
Oh, you did, too.  Oh, okay.


 Dave 
But, uh, I live in a kind of a staunchly -- Republican <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:449508" id="Pl-7" latLong="40.000°N 86.250°W" state="IN" type="CIVIL">state</PLACE>.  So, there
was really no way for my vote to make a difference.


 Lynn 
Which, you know, I I just think the electoral votes -- I don't know
what's wrong with everybody just taking, you know, a head count and
voting


 Dave 
Yeah.


 Lynn 
and doing away with the *electorials.


 Dave 
Well, you know, you're you're talking about,  um,  the Constitution
there, so,  I mean, you know, it takes a lot to change the
Constitution.  I know they're also -- I've been reading some articles
lately about they're -- thinking about, uh,  uh,  why should only a
native born person be allowed to, uh, be President.


 Lynn 
Oh, I know. That is kind of interesting to -- think that,  I mean, I
think it'll be a long time before -- they would change that.


 Dave 
Yeah, but, uh, just in the last uh, well, actually just in the last
month or so I -- is really the only time I've ever heard anybody even
even talk about it.  And, uh,  well, I I -- I did read a a column today
by,  uh,  a Hispanic fellow and, uh,  he wasn't native born, he was
from <PLACE country="CU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18380782" id="Pl-8" latLong="21.500°N 80.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Cuba</PLACE>,  and, uh,  he stated that, uh,  we he was in the fifth
grade and and, uh,  uh, he was taking -- no, I guess he was in middle
school and he was taking a civics class and and it was pointed out to
him that, you know, he could never become President.  And he stated at
that time, you know, he said, well, okay I can't be President I'll
never, you know, get involved in politics.  So,  you know, he kind of
thought that was unfair.


 Lynn 
Well, you know, in one sense it is but then, I mean -- well, my
grandparents came over, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:877159" id="Pl-9" latLong="40.699°N 74.040°W" state="NJ" type="RGN">Ellis Island</PLACE> and everything, but when I think
about, you know, a foreign person or maybe born in another country and
coming here it doe- it doesn't seem right in one sense for -- for them
to be able to be President of this <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-10" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>.


 Dave 
Right.


 Lynn 
But -- it kind of falls like -- I mean I've been on the internet lately
and I've ran across these really weird websites -- and I'm not a fanatic
or anything but they're all about the -- the new world, one world
government and things like that, you know,  and to me it's just
another point in that direction. Maybe eventually, you know,


 Dave 
Uh-huh.


 Lynn 
that won't make a you know, twenty or thirty, forty, fifty years down
the road.


 Dave 
Right, eh, so what do you think about George Bush?  Eh, are


 Lynn 
I I think he's a phony. I mean, that's another thing they were talking
about that he is with the Skull and Bones from I think he went to
Yale,


 Dave 
Right.


 Lynn 
and so was his father and and Clinton was, too, and and people
actually that +alumina


 Dave 
And Kerry was a Skull and Bones, also.


 Lynn 
Also, yeah, and then they -- I don't know what else they're called but
they're saying, like, they were like Satan people, Satan worshipers
and,


 Dave 
Oh.


 Lynn 
you know, and you don't know what to believe. I watched a show on
channel nine about Bush and him being religious,  spiritual, of
course, but also religious when his father wasn't,  and -- I don't know.
You know, you hea- I I think it's all a bunch of lies, and -- I I don't
I'm not crazy about Bush. There're some things about him, you know,
the fact that he does act spiritual and things like that, I like that,
I think that's what got him in office but,


 Dave 
Uh-huh.


 Lynn 
um


 Dave 
Well what do you think of him as a man? Do you think he's, uh, a good
man or do you think he's got -- any good qualities, or


 Lynn 
Uh, I -- you know, I want to say that he probably is but then I look at
the things like where he wants -- the things he's done. I think that
people are poorer.  I mean,  I just think the um, we're so much more
in debt. I just don't think he -- -- But as far as the man himself, I
again, I don't know.


 Dave 
Yeah.


 Lynn 
What do you think of him?


 Dave 
Well, I I think I think his dad was a better man than he is.  You
know,  to me,  you know, I'm kind of in the same boat you're in.  I
think he was just he's kind of the sizzle, you know, he's not the
steak.  I think he was just sold to the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> people.
