11. Holiday Traditions: The holiday season is right around the
corner. Who do you like to celebrate with during the holidays? Do you go
to a lot of parties with friends, neighbors, co-workers or family
members? Are there people you see during the holidays that you don't see
during the rest of the year? Do you travel to meet up with family or
friends during the holidays? Where do you go and who do you visit?

Yeah, I'm alm- I'm twenty-seven. I'm not quite there yet. Yeah.


 Carol 
Oh, you're young.  Yeah, you're too young.


 Britt 
But um, actually, this year I -we're going -- uh My parents are also
divorced, so it was always difficult because we had to, like, split
Christmas.


 Carol 
Sure.


 Britt 
So we would do, like, New Years with -I mean, um, Christmas Eve with
one set of, you know,  parents, and then Christmas day with the other.
So, yeah, it was always tough, so we never really went anywhere. But,
this year is, like,  all the children are old enough now that we don't
have to split Christmas, so-


 Carol 
Mhm.


 Britt 
We're actually, um, going to <PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18572019" id="Pl-10" latLong="46.000°N 2.000°E" type="COUNTRY">France</PLACE> for Christmas to have with my
aunt, so-

Yeah.  I'm leaving on Monday and coming back on the thirtieth, so um,


 Carol 
That is great.


 Britt 
yeah, ten days. I'm so excited.


 Carol 
Oh, that is wonderful.


 Britt 
Yeah, it's the first vacation I've had all year pretty much, so, so
yeah, I'm very much looking forward to it.


 Carol 
Oh, wow.  Oh, have a great time.


 Britt 
Thank you. Yeah.


 Carol 
That's exciting.


 Britt 
So it's going to be a little different -- this year especially, because
it's -- going to be a lot of people -some people I don't even know, and
um-


 Carol 
Sure.  Yeah, but a beautiful <PLACE country="FR" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:18572019" id="Pl-11" latLong="46.000°N 2.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>.


 Britt 
Duh-


 Carol 
Mhm, good for you.  Good for you.  That's great.  Good.  Mhm.


 Britt 
Or um, work parties. Although, this year everything's been so crazy a-
at,  at my office that they decided to have the holiday party in
January.


 Carol 
What type of work do you do?


 Britt 
Um, I work for a transportation planning consulting firm.  It's -- very
different. It takes a while to explain, too, it's just kind of like-


 Carol 
Sounds kind of crazy.


 Britt 
Yeah, it's, eh, we're not -- an architecture firm or a, or a
construction firm, and were not engineering either. We kind of


 Carol 
Mhm.


 Britt 
so the work that comes -- beforehand. So, like, when,


 Carol 
Okay.


 Britt 
you know, um,  I don't know, say <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780795" id="Pl-12" latLong="40.167°N 74.500°W" state="NJ" type="CIVIL">New Jersey</PLACE> Transit Authority comes to
us and says, we want a,  you know-


 Carol 
Mhm.  Oh.  Mhm.


 Britt 
so it's interesting.


 Carol 
Oh, that's different.


 Britt 
Yeah, and it


 Carol 
Well, I'm a teacher.


 Britt 
Oh, great. What -- what do you teach?


 Carol 
Uh, I teach adult high school right now. I'm retired from full-time
teaching,


 Britt 
Oh, wow.


 Carol 
but I teach adult high school, so I teach careers and history -- three
nights a week.


 Britt 
Oh, great.


 Carol 
And then I usually sub during the day -- or watch children. It depends.


 Britt 
Yeah.


 Carol 
But it's fun. I- I really enjoy it -- a lot.


 Britt 
I always wanted to be teacher. My parents kind of talked me out of it.


 Carol 
They were smart.


 Britt 
Yeah.


 Carol 
I talked my daughter out of it. No, I wouldn't recommend anyone going
into teaching now.


 Britt 
Really?


 Carol 
It's changed so dramatically.  Yeah.  I would not rec- as a matter of
fact I don't recommend it


 Britt 
Yeah.


 Carol 
to anybody.


 Britt 
Well, when I was- I wanted to be a music teacher and that would've
been even harder


 Carol 
Oh god, yeah.


 Britt 
I think because the- one, you get laid off first pr- you know, first
person to get laid off is going to be the arts and


 Carol 
Mhm.  That's right.  And that's what ha- what is happening.


 Britt 
which makes me so upset. Oh, I c- it drives my crazy, like,


 Carol 
Uh-huh.


 Britt 
i- you know, art and music are so


 Carol 
They're important.


 Britt 
so important to your culture and, you know, wh- having be a well
rounded person. I mean, you can't do it,  at least you could try, you
know, and you- I just- -- not everything can be academic, you know.


 Carol 
That's right.  Absolutely.
