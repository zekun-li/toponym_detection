The Coward - Part III

You may remember Pablo Paredes from an earlier posting of mine. He is
the coward who after volunteering for the Navy decided he doesn't want
to serve in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-1" latLong="33.000째N 44.000째E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> so he went AWOL all the while getting as much press as
possible from his Socialist buddies.

Well, he was &quot; surprised &quot; yesterday when he was formally charged
with AWOL and Missing A Movement (what took them so long?):

Petty Officer 3rd Class Pablo E. Paredes decided to protest the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000째N 44.000째E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>
war by not sailing with his ship when it left <PLACE id="Pl-115" type="FAC">San Diego Harbor</PLACE> on Dec.
6.

Yesterday, the Navy decided to charge Paredes, 23, with being absent
without leave and missing movement, charges that could send him to
military <PLACE id="Pl-116" type="FAC">prison</PLACE> for as long as a year and limit his employment options.

The action by the Navy surprised Paredes, who made headlines and drew
supporters and critics with his stance.

&quot;I showed up at the <PLACE id="Pl-119" type="FAC">base</PLACE> expecting to hear whether the local Navy
command had approved my conscientious objector status. Instead I was
read the charges against,&quot; said Paredes, who is on temporary duty at
<PLACE id="Pl-120" type="FAC">Naval Base San Diego</PLACE>.

This guy is in for an even bigger surprise once he gets his just
deserts. Hopefully he rots in <PLACE id="Pl-117" type="FAC">prison</PLACE> for the maximum which is one year
in <PLACE id="Pl-118" type="FAC">jail</PLACE>. Plus tack on forfeiture of pay, reduction in rank and a
bad-conduct discharge. Guess he can get a job as a secretary for
A.N.S.W.E.R. and his other buddies, doubt many will be hiring a shitbird
who has a Big Chicken Dinner on his record.

Thanks to Citizen Smash on the heads up and for doing such a great
job of holding this coward accountable.
