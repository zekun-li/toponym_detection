<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> forces moving ever closer to <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-11" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>, but military officials say
they are not counting on capitulation. For a look at what might lie ahead
for <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> forces, let's turn to our Miles O'Brien in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:351615 IGDB:352615" id="Pl-21" latLong="33.749°N 84.388°W" state="US-GA" type="PPLA">Atlanta</PLACE>.


 MILES O'BRIEN, CNN ANCHOR 
Thank you very much, Judy. To help guide us through all this discussion
about red zones, and daggers and exactly what is the strength of the
Republican Guard, we turn to Colonel Patrick Lang. He's retired with the
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> Army. He spent some time in the Defence Intelligence
Agency, among other things. Colonel, good to have you with us.


 COL. PAT LANG (RET,), <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> ARMY 
You're welcome.


 O'BRIEN 
What do you suppose right now would be the governor on the forward
advance? Is it the Republican Guard or is it the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> and coalition
supply lines? Or both?


 LANG 
Well, they are close enough up to <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-12" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> now so that the supply line
issue is probably not a big one since they had time to restock, food,
fuel and ammunition. So, probably the main thing is combing through the
rubble that the air force has left of these Republican Guard divisions to
make sure there are no strong points that you leave behind, that could
threaten your lines of supply once they get past. Once they are satisfied
they are through all that, I would imaging there will be a pause while
they start to reconnoiter into <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>, probing hard to see how much
resistance there really is.


 O'BRIEN 
Well, let me ask you that. First of all, I just wanted to tell viewers
where we just took our satellite imagery. This is that <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16892923 NGA:-3107077" id="Pl-20" latLong="32.250°N 43.117°E" state="IQ-KA" type="RGN">Karbala</PLACE> area which
is <SIGNAL id="S-1">about 50 miles</SIGNAL> from <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-14" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>. <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-15" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> is roughly in that direction from
there. We know the vanguard is supposedly as close as 15 miles. One of
the next key points along the way here is <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" id="Pl-274" type="FAC">Saddam international airport</PLACE>.
Do you suppose that is a key target right now?


 LANG 
Oh, I'm sure it is. I mean a feature of that importance would always be
something you'd want to hold. And besides, as soon as you get control of
it you'd be able to start using it for air operations, and put a survey
team in there as soon as it's secured, and then start using it for
helicopter operations, haul forward some big bladders of fuel to refuel
helicopters and rearm them and things like that. And if the front
stabilizes between there and the downtown <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-16" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>, they'll start using it
for a fixed wing aircraft as well.


 O'BRIEN 
Now, as you go from <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" id="Pl-285" type="FAC">Saddam International Airport</PLACE> into town you see there
are some big, wide divided highways there. Control of these highways will
be crucial won't it?


 LANG 
Yeah, these are the high-speed approaches into the heart of the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-22" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" mod="CENTRAL" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE> and
armored forces like the 3rd Mechanized Infantry Division just love
high-speed approaches. They will try to go down those things, cutting the
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-23" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE> up into sectors as best they can, and then work on the specific
sectors of the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-24" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE> they think are a key terrain. I would think,
probably, various facilities as well as major government buildings that
they need to control to set up a new government.


 O'BRIEN 
It's a big <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-25" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE>, about the size of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1210052 USGS:1209052" id="Pl-29" latLong="39.952°N 75.164°W" state="US-PA" type="PPL">Philadelphia</PLACE> or thereabouts. Some have
said <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:423587 IGDB:424587" id="Pl-30" latLong="41.850°N 87.650°W" state="US-IL" type="PPL">Chicago</PLACE> is a good analogy. Tremendous amount of force needed to
control a city of that source, or am a wrong?


 LANG 
Well, it depends on the attitude of the populous, which is not clear yet.
If the population, in fact, or at least a big part of them like the Shia
half of the population, if they want to be liberated, then you can
control them with a fairly small force. If, in fact, a lot of people in
the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-27" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE> don't want to be liberated and you're never going to know that
until you try, then you're going to need a much larger force, and we
might end up waiting a couple of weeks for reinforcements.


 O'BRIEN 
Based on what you've seen so far, what is your sense of that? The Shias
are a bit gun shy, if you will, in the south because of what happened in
1991. They rose up, didn't get <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-7" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> support. Do you suppose it will
be a different story in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-17" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>? Is there a lot of latent hatred for
Saddam Hussein that will come out?


 LANG 
Yes, there is, but these folks are going to be mighty cautious. They have
a long history of being kicked around by the Sunni Arab population of
central <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-1" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="CENTRAL" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>. And they don't have any particular reason to trust us, so
far. So they'll wait and see what happens. It's the other people in the
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-28" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE> you have to worry about, who are ethnically much the same as the
Saddam Hussein regime. And their behavior right now is unpredictable.


 O'BRIEN 
Colonel Patrick Lang, retired, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">United states</PLACE> Army, thanks for your
insights. A man who has been to <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-18" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> many times and can tell us with
great knowledge exactly what it's going to be like to fight on those
avenues in that sprawling city of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-19" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> - Judy.


 WOODRUFF 
Always helps Miles to hear a voice of experience. Thank you and thanks to
Colonel Lang. When we come back, hopes rising among investors. That means
