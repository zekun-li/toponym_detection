4. Peterson Trial Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering
his wife Laci and their unborn son, and he now faces the death
penalty.  Do you think he is guilty of the crimes he's been convicted
of?  If so, what were his motives?  How closely did you follow the
trial and what do you think of all of the media coverage of the trial?
What kind of sentencing should Peterson receive?


 Christina 
Hi.


 Greg 
Hi.


 Christina 
I'm Christina from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780780 USGS:1779780" id="Pl-1" latLong="41.667°N 72.667°W" state="US-CT" type="CIVIL">Connecticut</PLACE>.


 Greg 
I'm Greg from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1081996 USGS:1080996" id="Pl-2" latLong="39.961°N 82.999°W" state="US-OH" type="PPL">Columbus</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1085497 IGDB:1086497" id="Pl-3" latLong="40.250°N 83.000°W" state="US-OH" type="CIVIL">Ohio</PLACE>.


 Christina 
Oh, okay. Ooh, Scott Peterson. I was like, I got to talk to someone
about this. I have to voice my opinion. Well, no, I mean you could go
or, well


 Greg 
Uh, I -- Okay, go ahead.  Hey shoot, you got more sense than I do.


 Christina 
Okay, I -- have been following the trial, I don't know why, ever since
this whole thing happened. I am a stay at home mom, so I get to watch
the ~TV more often, and I -- you know have been fo- -- watching all
these forensic pathologists, Dr. Henry Lee. You know, and and what I
see is that there is no physical evidence that he did it.  And yeah,
it sounds like he did do it because he dyed his hair, was trying to
get away, and the anchor and a boat. But there's -- -- I for some
reason, deep down in my heart, don't believe he did it.  And you know
and I think the media made him guilty, and I think -- it's like you
know, I mean you saw what happened outside the <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-14" nonLocUse="true" state="US-CA" type="FAC">courtroom</PLACE>, I don't know
if you did or not, see how they were cheering on.  I don't think he's
guilty and, I hope he doesn't get the death penalty. And -- I don't
know.  I I just don't think he's guilty. I think he's wrong, what he
did, everything, he cheated on his wife, that's so wrong, but -- that
doesn't make him a murderer, he's just a cheater, he's just a -- you
know, like one hundred ten percent you know eighteen karat -- asshole,
like i- Mar- Mark Geragos called him.


 Greg 
Yeah.


 Christina 
How about you? You probably think he's guilty, or


 Greg 
Well -- Yeah, no I, I think, I think ((the guy's)) definitely guilty uh
Just based on, I haven't followed it all that closely, although you
can't help but follow it closely because there's so much crap on the
news.


 Christina 
Mhm.


 Greg 
But uh no i- the -- uh the I think well first of all, you know I agree
with you, I think cheating on your wife's pretty low.  But I think
what happened i- it's living the b- uh living large.  You could tell
both of them uh you look some of the things they had, you know,  he
had a few bucks or so. (()) finish, things were getting him down, uh
you know, you know how it is, day after day though -- M- marriage isn't
all that wonderful.


 Christina 
Right.


 Greg 
Eh, you know and I don't think he had faced that, and plus, you know,
a lot of the neat stuff from the outside, and particularly Amber Frey,
who I don't particularly think is neat, but it was something that uh
you know he went after


 Christina 
Mhm.


 Greg 
and so uh he figured, well -- these will, these things would get rid of
her I guess.  I don't, I don't know why like his uh, the wife's or the
mother said divorce is an option I think.


 Christina 
Yeah.  I know, that's very powerful. Not, you know, not murder and,
oh, I mean, I don't know.


 Greg 
But -- you know, I I can see, the guy wasn't thinking right. He was
screwed up, you know, a despicable human being and he, just -- You know,
the easy way out. This'll work, I guarantee I'm too damn smart.


 Christina 
But you know what, it's like I think they didn't want to find him
guilty because remember when ~OJ was not found guilty? I mean, oh my
God, the, you know, but it's like, ~<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1663328 USGS:1662328" id="Pl-4" latLong="34.052°N 118.243°W" state="US-CA" type="PPL">LA</PLACE> would have like, turned ~<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1663328 USGS:1662328" id="Pl-5" state="US-CA" type="PPL">LA</PLACE>
upside down, like all the, you know


 Greg 
Yeah.


 Christina 
I- it just, I don't know what would happen if he was found guilty, but
now I think they said that they wanted to prove that -- you know, okay,
we're not going to let this guy walk, like, don't let this guy walk
either, big high profile case.


 Greg 
Well, yeah you have to look, see, I think the locale, that both of
them took place, and one took place in ~<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1663328 USGS:1662328" id="Pl-6" state="US-CA" type="PPL">LA</PLACE>,  which is terribly open-
minded and, uh, the other one took place in uh, Mida- well, uh
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:277584 IGDB:278584" id="Pl-8" latLong="37.485°N 122.235°W" state="US-CA" type="PPL">((Redoak)) City</PLACE>.


 Christina 
Mhm.  <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:277584 IGDB:278584" id="Pl-9" latLong="37.485°N 122.235°W" state="US-CA" type="PPL">Redwood City</PLACE>, yeah.


 Greg 
And who, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:277584 IGDB:278584" id="Pl-10" latLong="37.485°N 122.235°W" state="US-CA" type="PPL">Redwood City</PLACE> is one of those things that would, uh shift <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:277593 IGDB:278593" id="Pl-11" latLong="37.775°N 122.418°W" state="US-CA" type="PPL">San
Francisco</PLACE> and ~<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1663328 USGS:1662328" id="Pl-7" state="US-CA" type="PPL">LA</PLACE> to, uh, to a red state rather than a blue state if
you let them. It's very, very conservative there.
