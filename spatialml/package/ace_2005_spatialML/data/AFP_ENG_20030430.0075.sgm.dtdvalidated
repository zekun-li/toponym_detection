The Daily Planet Ltd, about to become the first brothel to list on
the <PLACE country="AU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18443435" id="Pl-11" latLong="25.000°S 135.000°E" predicative="true" state="US-NV" type="COUNTRY">Australian</PLACE> Stock Exchange, plans to follow up its May Day
launching by opening a &quot;sex Disneyland&quot; here, the <PLACE country="AU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18413156" id="Pl-14" latLong="37.817°S 144.967°E" predicative="true" state="AU-VIC" type="PPLA">Melbourne</PLACE>-based
bordello announced Wednesday.

Chief executive Andrew Harris said the company was likely to abandon
plans to acquire a hotel in <PLACE country="AU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18396865" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.883°S 151.217°E" state="AU-NSW" type="PPLA">Sydney</PLACE>'s <PLACE country="AU" form="NAM" id="Pl-18" state="AU-NSW" type="RGN">Kings Cross</PLACE> red light district
and acquire another property three times the size in a better
location.

The Daily Planet raised 3.5 million dollars (2.2 million <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>) in its
initial public offering with one of the new 600 shareholders
acquiring 1.0 million dollars worth of shares.

Renowned <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1661757" id="Pl-19" latLong="34.098°N 118.326°W" predicative="true" state="US-CA" type="PPL">Hollywood</PLACE> madam Heidi Fleiss has been flown to <PLACE country="AU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18413156" id="Pl-15" latLong="37.817°S 144.967°E" state="AU-VIC" type="PPLA">Melbourne</PLACE> as
guest of honour at Thursday's market debut and, according to Harris,
has already played a key role in attracting worldwide media attention
to the event.

&quot;Heidi's ideas, her background, her knowledge have helped us a great
deal,&quot; he said. &quot;The international novelty value with Heidi promoting
it has been massive -- these shares can go anywhere.&quot;

But it hasn't been an easy road to the <PLACE country="AU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18443435" id="Pl-12" latLong="25.000°S 135.000°E" nonLocUse="true" type="COUNTRY">Australian</PLACE> Stock Exchange
since the idea was first mooted in 1994.

&quot;The establishment did not want a brothel on the stock exchange,&quot;
Harris said.

&quot;It's only because we were the biggest and the best that we could
afford to do it.

&quot;We have fought every institution, every law firm ... it's cost us a
fortune but now we're going on a massive expansion.&quot;

Harris said <PLACE country="AU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18396865" id="Pl-7" latLong="33.883°S 151.217°E" state="AU-NSW" type="PPLA">Sydney</PLACE> was a more attractive option for the sex
Disneyland because its prostitution laws are less restrictive than
<PLACE country="AU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18413156" id="Pl-16" latLong="37.817°S 144.967°E" state="AU-VIC" type="PPLA">Melbourne</PLACE>'s.

&quot;Prostitution is completely decriminalised in <PLACE country="AU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18396865" id="Pl-8" latLong="33.883°S 151.217°E" state="AU-NSW" type="PPLA">Sydney</PLACE> and we are going
to build a monster,&quot; he said.

&quot;We want a complete one-stop adult venue -- we want a complete adult
venue with adult cinemas, adult shops... we have found much bigger
premises in a much better location to create a sex Disneyland.&quot;

The company is also considering franchising The Daily Planet within
<PLACE country="AU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18443435" id="Pl-13" latLong="25.000°S 135.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Australia</PLACE> with likely venues in <PLACE country="AU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18405325" id="Pl-21" latLong="31.933°S 115.833°E" state="AU-WA" type="PPLA">Perth</PLACE>, <PLACE country="AU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18438272" id="Pl-22" latLong="27.500°S 153.017°E" state="AU-QLD" type="PPLA">Brisbane</PLACE>, <PLACE country="AU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18396865" id="Pl-9" latLong="33.883°S 151.217°E" mod="W" state="AU-NSW" type="PPLA">Sydney</PLACE>'s western

But The Daily Planet is saving its big plans for the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE>
where it is negotiating with two well-known <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> personalities to join
the board.

&quot;The <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> is our major thrust,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to build a
little city called <PLACE comment="hypothetical" country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-24" state="US-NV" type="PPL">Metropolis</PLACE> with a 150-200 room <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-26" state="US-NV" type="FAC">hotel</PLACE> in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780793" id="Pl-20" latLong="39.250°N 116.750°W" state="US-NV" type="CIVIL">Nevada</PLACE>.&quot;
