Saddam Hussein is Losing Grip on Northern Cities in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-3" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>

 WOODRUFF 
Yesterday, there were scenes of jubilation in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>, today, a suicide
bombing and firefighters, grim reminders that, as <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> Central Command
put it, <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> is still an ugly place. CNN's John Irvine has this
profile of a <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-9" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE> literally teetering on a razor's edge.

Getting acquainted, very deliberately, the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> Marines are trying to
strike up a rapport with the people who are now their responsibility. But
there are still problems bringing control to <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>, particularly at
nighttime. In the pitch black of a <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-10" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE> without power, these soldiers
manning a <PLACE country="IE" form="NOM" id="Pl-77" state="IQ-BG" type="FAC">roadblock</PLACE> became nervous.

When a car fails to stop, it's the cue for a violent gun battle. Bullets
are sprayed everywhere. In parts of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-7" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> that the Americans haven't
yet reached, there has been looting. This man took the horse from a
<PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-100" type="FAC">stable</PLACE> at the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-78" state="IQ-BG" type="FAC">home</PLACE> of Uday Hussein, Saddam's eldest son. We found the
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-79" state="IQ-BG" type="FAC">house</PLACE>, a large, gaudy <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-80" state="IQ-BG" type="FAC">structure</PLACE>, a <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-81" state="IQ-BG" type="FAC">place</PLACE> that just a few days ago people
didn't even look at for fear of their lives. This indeed was one of
Uday's homes. Here, the ruling family could look out over the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16895173 NGA:-3104827" id="Pl-11" latLong="31.000°N 47.417°E" type="WATER">Tigris</PLACE>.
People have wasted no time clearing the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-82" state="IQ-BG" type="FAC">house</PLACE> and wrecking what couldn't
be easily taken. (on camera): They haven't quite worked out just how to
reach this will chandelier yet. But, other than that, they have stripped
this <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-83" state="IQ-BG" type="FAC">place</PLACE> bare in less than 24 hours. Call it plunder, if you will, or
perhaps payback. (voice-over): These Iraqis were rifling a <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-88" state="IQ-BG" type="FAC">home</PLACE> of a
senior member of the Mukhabarat, Saddam's dreaded secret police. It also
seemed to be some kind of monitoring <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-90" type="FAC">station</PLACE>. There was sophisticated
equipment here. In the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-96" state="IQ-BG" type="FAC">basement</PLACE>, we found burning archives and evidence
of electronic surveillance. This had been a <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-93" type="FAC">nerve center</PLACE> for spying, a
<PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-94" type="FAC">place</PLACE> from where the bully boys kept tabs to keep control. (on camera):
We're now in the <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-97" type="FAC">bowels</PLACE> of a secret police monitoring <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-95" type="FAC">station</PLACE>. Look at
all this gadgetry, quite sinister really, part of the apparatus of Big
Brother. (voice-over): These people are stealing from a <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-98" state="IQ-BG" type="FAC">shopping center</PLACE>.
It has become widespread, but it's not being done with total impunity.
These thieves are trying to flee the <PLACE country="DE" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-1775655 IGDB:18224345" id="Pl-12" latLong="51.500°N 10.500°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">German</PLACE> <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" id="Pl-99" state="IQ-BG" type="FAC">Embassy</PLACE>, having been shot at
by a guard. John Irvine, ITV News, <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-8" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="IQ-BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>.
