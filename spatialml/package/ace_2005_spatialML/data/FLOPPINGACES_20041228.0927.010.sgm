2Slick pointed me to a article at In <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-1" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> For 365 . This is a great
blog and I encourage you all to read it regularly. On Sunday he wrote of
two <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> soldiers who didn't see us as conquerors but as allies when
the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897344" id="Pl-9" latLong="36.335°N 43.119°E" predicative="true" state="IQ-NI" type="PPLA">Mosul</PLACE> bombing occurred. The suicide bomb sprayed bb-like fragments
throughout the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" id="Pl-47" predicative="true" state="IQ-NI" type="FAC">Marez</PLACE> dining <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-50" state="IQ-NI" type="FAC">facility</PLACE>. One piece of shrapnel sliced
through the femoral artery of a <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> soldier and his only chance for
survival was in the hands of these two Iraqis.

Recalling the medical classes they'd received from the special
forces, the Iraqis reacted calmly, fastening a belt above the wound,
creating a tourniquet, which stopped the gushing stream of red. They
moved the soldier to a MEDVAC vehicle via two-man litter carry. After
they hoisted the soldier in the truck, the two Iraqis -- one an officer,
the other an NCO -- ran back to the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-48" state="IQ-NI" type="FAC">facility</PLACE> and began treating the other
wounded without regard for their safety.

When the dust settled and the mess <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-49" state="IQ-NI" type="FAC">tent</PLACE> had been evacuated, everybody
who could talk was questioned about their health. When the medics came
to the two Iraqis, the ING soldiers only wanted to know how everybody
else was. When asked why did they do it, they simply stated, &quot;this was
our duty; we are a team, and we take care of each other.&quot; Even the
Americans. No matter what the MSM tries to tell you, there are Iraqi's
who will help the allies, who will fight alongside them and put their
lives at risk to make sure Democracy succeeds in their <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-10" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>. This
brings to mind a speech Prime Minister Tony Blair gave recently while
visiting <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-3" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>. When I meet the people working alongside the United
Nations--Iraqis in fear of their life every day, because they are trying
to bring freedom and democracy to their people--when I see their courage
and their determination and know that they speak for the vast majority
of people in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> who want that democracy and freedom, then I know that
we are doing the right thing. . . .

And I will also say this to you: There are people dying in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, but
the reason people are dying is because of the terrorism and the
intimidation and the people who are deliberately killing anyone trying
to make this <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-11" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> better.

Now what should our response be as an international community? Our
response should be to stand alongside the democrats--the people who've
got the courage to see this thing through--and help them see it through.
I've got no doubt at all that that is the right thing for us to do. . .
.

Sometimes when I see some of the reporting of what's happening in
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> in the rest of the world, I just feel that people should understand
how precious what has been created here is. And those people from that
electoral commission that I described as the heroes of the new
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-7" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>--every day . . . a lot of them aren't living in the Green Zone,
they've got to travel in from outside. They do not know at any point in
time whether they're going to be subject to brutality or intimidation,
even death, and yet they carry on doing it. Now what a magnificent
example of the human spirit--that's the side we should be on.
