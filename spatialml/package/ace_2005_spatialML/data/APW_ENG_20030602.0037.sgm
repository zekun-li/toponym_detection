<PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-30" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE> has told <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-19" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> lawmakers it already has nuclear
weapons and intends to build more, a senior <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> congressman said
Monday after returning from a trip to the communist <PLACE country="KP" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-53" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">state</PLACE>.

``They admitted to having nuclear capability and weapons at this
moment,'' said Rep. Curt Weldon, who headed a delegation of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE>
lawmakers that visited <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19816541" id="Pl-48" latLong="39.019°N 125.755°E" state="KP-PYO" type="PPLC">Pyongyang</PLACE> for three days ending Sunday. ``They
admitted to an effort to expand their nuclear production program.''

Weldon's comments echoed those of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> officials following talks in
<PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18101459" id="Pl-54" latLong="39.929°N 116.388°E" state="CN-11" type="PPLC">Beijing</PLACE> in April. They said that <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-31" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE> claimed during a pause
in the formal talks that it already had nuclear weapons, but would
give up the program in return for economic aid and security
guarantees.

Weldon said at a news conference in <PLACE country="KR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19283417" id="Pl-36" latLong="37.566°N 127.000°E" state="KR-11" type="PPLC">Seoul</PLACE> that <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-32" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korean</PLACE> Vice
Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan repeated that claim during a dinner
meeting. Both Kim and Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun told Weldon that
<PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19816541" id="Pl-49" latLong="39.019°N 125.755°E" state="KP-PYO" type="PPLC">Pyongyang</PLACE> planned to produce more nuclear weapons and had nearly
finished reprocessing the spent nuclear fuel rods needed to do so,
despite pressure from the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-14" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> and its allies.

``They admitted to having just about completed the reprocessing of
8,000 rods,'' said Weldon, a Republican who is the No. 2 member of a
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> House panel that oversees the armed forces.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> experts say that reprocessing the rods could give <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-33" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE>
several more nuclear bombs within months.

During their visit to <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19816541" id="Pl-50" latLong="39.019°N 125.755°E" state="KP-PYO" type="PPLC">Pyongyang</PLACE>, Weldon's delegation also met Choe
Thae Bok, chairman of <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-34" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE>'s legislature, the Supreme People's
Assembly.

Although they were not traveling as envoys of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-7" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> President George
W. Bush, they were the first <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-18" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> officials to visit since the
nuclear standoff began in October. They flew to <PLACE country="KR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19283417" id="Pl-37" latLong="37.566°N 127.000°E" state="KR-11" type="PPLC">Seoul</PLACE> on Sunday to
brief <PLACE country="KR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19283410" id="Pl-42" latLong="37.000°N 127.500°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">South Korean</PLACE> officials on their <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-55" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Northern</PLACE> trip.

<PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-20" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE> said it was developing its nuclear weapons as ``a
response to what they saw happened in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-56" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, with the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> removing
Saddam Hussein from power,'' Weldon said.

A <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-21" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">North Korean</PLACE> foreign ministry spokesman was quoted as saying by
<PLACE country="KP" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-57" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">state</PLACE>-run KCNA news agency that the visit helped both sides better
understand each other and they shared the view that <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-58" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="US-DC" type="PPLC">Washington</PLACE> and
<PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19816541" id="Pl-51" latLong="39.019°N 125.755°E" state="KP-PYO" type="PPLC">Pyongyang</PLACE> needed to avoid confrontation and exist peacefully.

``They were of the same view that it is necessary to seek a
negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue and expressed their stand
that it is necessary to continue seeking and discussing ways of
settling it,'' the spokesman said.

<PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-22" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE> has repeatedly accused <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-59" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="US-DC" type="PPLC">Washington</PLACE> of planing to invade.
Bush says he prefers a diplomatic solution, but has not ruled out a
military option.

In <PLACE country="KR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19283417" id="Pl-38" latLong="37.566°N 127.000°E" state="KR-11" type="PPLC">Seoul</PLACE>, <PLACE country="KR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19283410" id="Pl-43" latLong="37.000°N 127.500°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">South Korean</PLACE> President Roh Moo-hyun said his government has
no ``clear proof'' to conclude <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-23" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE> has nuclear weapons.

``<PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-24" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE> has told important people of the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-15" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> that it
has developed nukes and reprocessed spent fuel rods. But <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-25" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE>
has not confirmed that to anyone else,'' Roh said. ``Thus, we must
make a very careful judgment on whether we will conclude it has
nuclear weapons or not, based on those words only.''

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> and <PLACE country="KR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19283410" id="Pl-44" latLong="37.000°N 127.500°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">South Korean</PLACE> officials say that <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-26" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE> may be bluffing
about its nuclear program in an attempt to extract concessions from
the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-16" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE>. But <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-10" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz
said Monday that the threat couldn't be ignored.

``Certainly what we know suggests that we should take what they
(<PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-27" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">North Korean</PLACE> officials) are saying very seriously,'' he said at a
news conference in <PLACE country="KR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19283417" id="Pl-39" latLong="37.566°N 127.000°E" state="KR-11" type="PPLC">Seoul</PLACE>.

Weldon said his delegation ``comes away convinced'' that the nuclear
standoff can be resolved in a peaceful manner that allows <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19816541" id="Pl-52" latLong="39.019°N 125.755°E" state="KP-PYO" type="PPLC">Pyongyang</PLACE>'s
communist regime to stand while removing its nuclear threats.

Roh issued a similar message during a nationally televised news
conference.

``<PLACE country="KR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19283410" id="Pl-45" latLong="37.000°N 127.500°E" type="COUNTRY">South Korea</PLACE> and the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-17" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> share a firm principle that <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-62" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North
Korea</PLACE> should never possess nuclear weapons and that the issue should
be resolved through a peaceful manner,'' he said.

Roh spoke after meeting the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-11" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> lawmakers and Wolfowitz, who also
arrived in <PLACE country="KR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19283417" id="Pl-40" latLong="37.566°N 127.000°E" state="KR-11" type="PPLC">Seoul</PLACE> on Sunday for a two-day visit to discuss <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-64" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North
Korea</PLACE>.

Wolfowitz said Saturday in <PLACE country="SG" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19926364" id="Pl-65" latLong="1.367°N 103.800°E" type="COUNTRY">Singapore</PLACE> that <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-60" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="US-DC" type="PPLC">Washington</PLACE> hoped putting
pressure on <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-28" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE>'s battered economy would resolve the nuclear
standoff. On Monday, Wolfowitz stressed that military readiness was
just as important.

In meetings with <PLACE country="KR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19283410" id="Pl-46" latLong="37.000°N 127.500°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">South Korean</PLACE> officials, Wolfowitz urged them to
increase military spending on new technologies and telecommunications
equipment, as <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-12" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> forces have done. <PLACE country="KR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19283410" id="Pl-47" latLong="37.000°N 127.500°E" type="COUNTRY">South Korea</PLACE> earmarks about
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-66" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>$14.5 billion for its military.

``They still work with paper and pencil instead of with the kind of
modern communications gear that our special forces took with them to
<PLACE country="AF" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16632074" id="Pl-67" latLong="33.000°N 65.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Afghanistan</PLACE>,'' Wolfowitz said.

He said upgrades would allow troops to react quicker to threats from
the <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-68" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North</PLACE> and help reduce the possibility of a military conflict on
the <PLACE form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:208826267" id="Pl-69" type="RGN">peninsula</PLACE>, not heighten it.

The nuclear crisis flared last October when <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-13" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> officials said <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-63" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North
Korea</PLACE> admitted running a secret nuclear weapons program in violation
of a 1994 accord with <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-61" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="US-DC" type="PPLC">Washington</PLACE>.
