Boeing: The costs of lapses in ethical judgment

Boeing has managed to become a perfect case study in how corporate
ethics codes frequently do not translate into action. Last week, I wrote
about research that asks when do ethics codes influence executive action
. Boeing illustrates the costs (to person and company) of ignoring
corporate codes of conduct.

First the juicy news : Costs to person

Boeing Forces CEO Harry Stonecipher to Resign Over Relationship With
Female Executive from AP via Yahoo!

Boeing said an internal investigation prompted by information sent
anonymously to Chairman Lew Platt and the company's legal and ethics
leaders 10 days ago revealed a &quot;consensual&quot; relationship between
Stonecipher and the female executive that the board determined was in
violation of the company's code of conduct. The key here is that
Stonecipher's actions violated the code of conduct. This might be a grey
area if Boeing did not have rules governing this type of activity..but
it does. As Chairman Lew Platt says, &quot;The Board concluded that the facts
reflected poorly on Harry's judgment and would impair his ability to
lead the company.&quot; It is not the relationship, per se, but initiating it
in violation of a stated code of conduct that is a troubling action by a
CEO.

Next up: Costs to company

Today, the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-1" state="NY" type="ROAD">Wall Street</PLACE> Journal reports on details of the Air Force's
decision to allow Boeing to bid again on rocket contracts. You may
recall that Boeing was banned from such contracts for significant
ethical lapses in previous contract bidding. Specifically, Boeing
illegally procured and used information from rival bidder Lockheed
Martin. The Air Force is imposing an unprecedented and costly set of
ethics program oversight rules. While some may feel that the rules
unfairly meddle in Boeing's internal affairs, I think it is useful to
remember that Boeing brought them on through their own actions. Boeing
betrayed the trust of one of its primary customers. Once trust is
betrayed it is hard to get it back. Lack of trust is one of the primary
reasons we increase transaction costs by negotiating written contracts
with multiple stipulations (think pre-nuptual agreements here). From the
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-2" state="NY" type="ROAD">Wall Street</PLACE> Journal article: &quot;The extent of some of the controls,
according to government officials, partly reflects Boeing's failure to
comply with an earlier administrative agreement with the Air Force.&quot;

Boeing continues to be a bit of an ethical sinkhole. Hopefully, these
recent actions signal a bottoming out and Boeing can begin to reclaim
some of its former glory as a symbol of business success. Unfortunately,
losing trust is much easier than rebuilding trust.
