The foreign minister of <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-3" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE> has state that <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-4" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE> has
nuclear weapons and has officially with drawn from the 6 nation talks on
Nuclear proliferation in east <PLACE continent="AI" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:30009613" id="Pl-16" mod="E" type="CONTINENT">Asia</PLACE>.

The Foreign minister also indicated that <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-5" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE> will continue to
develop long range missiles capable of obliterating any target within
the borders of the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-17" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE>.

According to <PLACE continent="AI" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:30009613" id="Pl-21" mod="E" type="CONTINENT">East Asia</PLACE> Intelligence sources, <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-6" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE> has already
prepositioned nuclear tipped missiles on Freighters and Fishing trawlers
that are sailing under foreign flags of convenience, that are stationed
off the west <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:208918643" id="Pl-22" mod="W" type="RGN">coast</PLACE> and East <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:208918467" id="Pl-23" mod="E" type="RGN">coast</PLACE> of the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-18" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE>. Missiles
launched from these vessels are said to be able to hit 90% percent of
the major cities with in 2 and one half minutes from time of launch.

I don't know about the rest of you but I think that in the next few
weeks I will be moving supplies and equipment to my site in eastern <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1156107" id="Pl-24" latLong="44.000°N 120.500°W" mod="E" state="OR" type="CIVIL">Oregon</PLACE>.

Of course you can do what you want but I don't trust the pot bellied
idiot Kim Junk Ill any farther than I could throw him.

Well here is the problem that I face and many should be worried about.
If <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-8" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE> has had nuclear weapons for a few years then they
developed them during the Clinton Administration.

The Clinton Administration also allowed Loral to sell Missile technology
to <PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18099327" id="Pl-25" latLong="35.000°N 105.000°E" type="COUNTRY">China</PLACE>, who have been helping <PLACE country="PK" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17229029" id="Pl-26" latLong="30.000°N 70.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Pakistan</PLACE> to build their missiles. That
technology has undoubtably made it back to <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-9" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE> (<PLACE country="PK" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17229029" id="Pl-27" latLong="30.000°N 70.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Pakistan</PLACE>, <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-28" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iran</PLACE>
and <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-10" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE> are all working on the same set of missile blue prints).

So now we have <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-11" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE> with nuclear weapons and workable missiles.

Also since we missed the boat on <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-12" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE> and Nuclear weapons how can
we be sure that <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-34" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iran</PLACE> doesn't have nuclear weapons? The simple and
wisest action is to assume that they do have a small number and are
working feverishly to build a bigger arsenal.

Now the nut of the question should be, What if <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-29" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iran</PLACE> gives, sells,
provides nuclear weapons to Islamic extremists to smuggle into the
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-19" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> and at 10 AM on a Wednesday pop 2 or 3 in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-30" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL">New York City</PLACE>,
destroying <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208991647" id="Pl-31" state="NY" type="ROAD">Wall street</PLACE>, the large banks, the large Insurance companies,
the large sock brokerage houses and many other world wide financial
institutions.

At the same time 2 weapons go off in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-32" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="DC" type="PPL">Washington</PLACE> <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1703382" id="Pl-44" latLong="38.917°N 77.001°W" state="DC">DC</PLACE> and take out the
President, the Vice President, 80 Senators, and 350 congressmen as well
as the department of the treasury, Interior, Health and Welfare,
Justice, Commerce and the Federal Court system. And then just for yucks
lets assume that one goes off at the Pentagon.

Now what do we do?

Remember all your pension funds are now gone.
all your investments are gone.
all the bank records are gone.
No more government payments for federal employees.
No more government payments for aid to schools, environment,
police, courts, Well fare, etc.
The Dollar is now worthless on the international market.
With a worthless dollar the amount of fuel available is not
cut by 80%.
No more cheap imports of clothes, boots, appliances, computer
stuff, communications equipment, generators, electric motors
Cars, Trucks etc.
Massive unemployment as we are now in a service economy with
nothing to service.

Does the word TEOTWAWKI have any meaning.

Oh I expect to things to hang together for a few weeks as local, county,
and state governments try to hold things together, but they won't.

With out fuel to move food stuffs from the farms to food manufactures to
local warehouses food stuffs will dry up with in a few week or so.

With out fuel to move imported stuff (most of what we buy these days)
from the ports of entry to local warehouses and local retailer shelves
of items like building materials, tools, and every thing else we buy the
shelves will be empty in a month or so.

Of course the above does not take into account that people driven by
fear don't riot and loot every thing in site in the first week.

If the attack should happen in the winter, no Natural gas from <PLACE country="CA" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19437937" id="Pl-35" latLong="60.000°N 96.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Canada</PLACE> to
heat homes, or fire steam driven electrical generators. Of course we
could convert back to coal but it will take a couple of weeks to convert
them to coal but then how do you get the coal from the mines to the
power plants???

With no Social Security or pension payments, Aid to Dependent Children
and other government payments, food stamps, (which are all checks and
vouchers), and there are no banks to cash them, (they got all wiped out
in the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-36" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL">New York</PLACE> financial destruction remember) no body will accept them.

No the situation doesn't look good from where I sit.

Oh we can work on the assumption that the Mullahs of <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-37" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iran</PLACE> will be
rational, (but how rational are people who train and fund suicide
bombers) and a rational Kim Junk Ill (who lets large numbers of his
people starve to death every year so he can have nuclear weapons)
kidnaps <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-38" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japanese</PLACE> Citizens to teach English, Kidnaps movie stars so he
can have private performances etc. Look at Kim Jung Ill behavior over
the last decade or so any you will find that Hitler was a saint compared
to Kim Junk Ill.

No it's going to be a scary time for the next decade or so and the
neo-chamberlins (most of the leftist that most on this board) (you know
prime minister chamberlin holding up his piece of paper containing an
agreement from Herr Hitler with peace in our time), are not going to do
one thing to keep this <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-45" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> safe.

By the way I consider, Kerry, Dean, Kennedy, Carl Levin, Lathey, Murry,
Finestien, Boxer, (Oh hell the whole Democratic party) and members of
the press as neo-chamberlins.

Well on to a happier note.

I have a job interview today for a permanent position that will pay 20%
more than my contracting does and will have benefits.

Contracting here in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1156107" id="Pl-39" latLong="44.000°N 120.500°W" state="OR" type="CIVIL">Oregon</PLACE> is going at $14.00 an hour at Intell, up to
$20 an hour at other places. Why should Hi tech firms pay more in the
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-20" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> than they do in <PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18099327" id="Pl-40" latLong="35.000°N 105.000°E" type="COUNTRY">China</PLACE> or <PLACE country="IN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17902205" id="Pl-41" latLong="20.000°N 77.000°E" type="COUNTRY">India</PLACE>?

Just heard yesterday that Hewlett Packard is shutting down its plant in
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1121527" id="Pl-42" latLong="44.052°N 123.086°W" state="OR" type="PPL">Eugene</PLACE>, (Thank you very much MS. Fiorina)and SUN Micro systems is all
but gone from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1156107" id="Pl-43" latLong="44.000°N 120.500°W" state="OR" type="CIVIL">Oregon</PLACE>. Fortunately my interview is with a engineered to
specification custom manufacturing facility.
