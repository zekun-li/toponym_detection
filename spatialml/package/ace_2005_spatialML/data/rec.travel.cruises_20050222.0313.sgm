Carnival Corp - Shareholder Discount on Princess

 Carnival Corp - Shareholder Discount on Princess 

I'm taking a 7 day cruise with Princess in March and applied for my $100
Carnival Corp. Shareholder onboard credit.

Turns out that my travel Agent has a 'group' cruise on this ship and my
$50/pp credit due to the 'group' cruise makes me ineligible for the
shareholder credit. This really makes a mockery of the Shareholder credit
as almost every cruise has some sort of small credit attached.

$100 won't break the bank or make the cruise less enjoyable, nor will I stop
being a shareholder, but I do find this sort of thing irritating.

This is incorrect. Have your TA get in touch with Rebecca Faroy at
Carnival Corp's Investor's Relations department. It seems that some
Princess people aren't fully aware of the correct policy. The Shareholder
Credit does apply to group bookings.

George has it right. I have been on two group cruises and received my
shareholder credit for both. (one Carnival Cruise, one HAL cruise)

Anyone have an idea if they will renew the shareholder credit arrangement?
As it is now, it expires July 1, I think.

Liza McDaniel in Yield Management denied us the shareholder
discount last Thanksgiving because our TA had included us in a group.

 Re: Carnival Corp - Shareholder Discount on Princess FYI 

    

One other item...did you contact Princess to submit your shareholder docs?
The Carnival office in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:295478" id="Pl-2" latLong="28.750°N 82.500°W" state="US-FL" type="CIVIL">Florida</PLACE> only accepts docs for Carnival cruises....the
other Carnival properties have to be contacted directly to submit
shareholder docs. Ex: I sent my docs to HAL in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1513650" id="Pl-3" latLong="47.606°N 122.331°W" state="US-WA" type="PPL">Seattle</PLACE> for my HAL cruise,
even though Carnival owns HAL.

You can get the larger of the shipboard credits. Until recently you
could combine the stockholder credits with the credits for booking on
board, but not with those from your agent.

The most recent Carnival report under Shareholder Benefit says, &quot;not
combinable with any other shipboard offer&quot;.

Therefore I recently sold my stock. (Made a nice profit.)

Me, too, though I am no stock guru. I cannot figure a place to put my $$
other than the cruise industry. Reports I read sound pretty rosey compared
to other parts of the economy.

Don't give up. I believe that clause actually refers to promo cruises etc.
and not to discounts, or shipboard credits offered by your TA.

I have doubled up on shareholder credits on both Carnival Corp. cruises and
RCL cruises. Maybe you need a different travel agent.
