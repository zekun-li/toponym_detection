<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-45" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="US-DC" type="PPLC">WASHINGTON</PLACE>, April 28 (AFP) - <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-21" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE> has offered to scrap its
nuclear weapons and missile programs, but only in return for
&quot;considerable&quot; diplomatic, political and economic concessions, the
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> said Monday.

Secretary of State Colin Powell said the offer was made during
three-way talks between <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>, <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-13" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">North Korean</PLACE> and <PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18099327" id="Pl-22" latLong="35.000°N 105.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Chinese</PLACE> diplomats last
week in <PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18101459" id="Pl-23" latLong="39.929°N 116.388°E" state="CN-11" type="PPLC">Beijing</PLACE>.

At the same meeting <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19816541" id="Pl-27" latLong="39.019°N 125.755°E" state="KP-PYO" type="PPLC">Pyongyang</PLACE> confirmed it had nuclear weapons, and
threatened to prove it with a &quot;display.&quot;

&quot;The North Koreans acknowledged a number of things that they were
doing and, in effect, said that these are now up for further
discussion,&quot; he told reporters at the State Department.

&quot;They did put forward a plan that would ultimately deal with their
nuclear capability and their missile activities, but they, of course,
expect something considerable in return,&quot; Powell said.

&quot;We are studying that plan, we are examining it with our friends and
allies,&quot; Powell said, adding that talks were now underway with the
<PLACE country="KR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19283410" id="Pl-34" latLong="37.000°N 127.500°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">South Korean</PLACE>, <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-38" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Japanese</PLACE>, <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-11" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Russian</PLACE> and <PLACE country="AU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18443435" id="Pl-46" latLong="25.000°S 135.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">Australian</PLACE> as well as other
governments.

&quot;It was useful to get it all out on the table and see where we go
from here,&quot; he said, referring to the April 23 to 25 discussions in
<PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18101459" id="Pl-24" latLong="39.929°N 116.388°E" state="CN-11" type="PPLC">Beijing</PLACE>.

Powell gave no indication as to whether <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-39" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="US-DC" type="PPLC">Washington</PLACE> would accept the
offer, and did not address what <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19816541" id="Pl-28" latLong="39.019°N 125.755°E" state="KP-PYO" type="PPLC">Pyongyang</PLACE> was demanding in terms of
concesssions.

However other <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> officials said the North Koreans had presented a
lengthy list of demands.

The demands include full normalization of ties with the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-7" type="COUNTRY">United
States</PLACE>, security guarantees and economic assistance that include oil
and other energy considerations.

&quot;They had quite a list of things,&quot; State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher told reporters.

Asked specifically about normalization of relations and economic
assistance, Boucher replied: &quot;I don't really quibble with that
characterization of the list.&quot;

A senior State Department official said later that the list of
demands was so extensive that it defied a &quot;concise description.&quot;

&quot;It basically listed everything they have ever asked for,&quot; the
official told reporters on condition of anonymity, identifying oil
and energy supplies as demands.

Although the <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-14" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">North Korean</PLACE> demands are being looked at, Boucher
repeated long-standing <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> policy that <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-40" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="US-DC" type="PPLC">Washington</PLACE> would not be
blackmailed or otherwise threatened into buying <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19816541" id="Pl-29" latLong="39.019°N 125.755°E" state="KP-PYO" type="PPLC">Pyongyang</PLACE> off.

&quot;We've made clear we're not going to pay for elimination of the
nuclear weapons programs that never should have begun in the first
place,&quot; he said.

Powell acknowledged that <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-15" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE> had hinted it could prove it
possessed nuclear weapons with some sort of display during the
<PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18101459" id="Pl-25" latLong="39.929°N 116.388°E" state="CN-11" type="PPLC">Beijing</PLACE> talks, but maintained that the North Koreans had not used the
words &quot;test&quot; or &quot;testing.&quot;

&quot;They said that it is the kind of capability that one can display in
one way or another,&quot; he said.

The concessions demanded by <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19816541" id="Pl-30" latLong="39.019°N 125.755°E" state="KP-PYO" type="PPLC">Pyongyang</PLACE> were part of a &quot;bold&quot; proposal
for addressing the nuclear situation on the <PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208826267" id="Pl-47" type="RGN">Korean peninsula</PLACE> that
<PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-16" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE> presented in <PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18101459" id="Pl-26" latLong="39.929°N 116.388°E" state="CN-11" type="PPLC">Beijing</PLACE>, officials said.

<PLACE country="KR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19283410" id="Pl-35" latLong="37.000°N 127.500°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">South Korean</PLACE> newspapers reported earlier Monday that the <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-48" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North</PLACE>
suggested that <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19816541" id="Pl-31" latLong="39.019°N 125.755°E" state="KP-PYO" type="PPLC">Pyongyang</PLACE> and <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-41" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="US-DC" type="PPLC">Washington</PLACE> act simultaneously and
equally to resolve the six-month-old nuclear crisis.

Boucher ruled out simultaneous steps by both sides, stressing that
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-42" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="US-DC" type="PPLC">Washington</PLACE> would not consider such moves until the &quot;verifiable and
irreversible termination&quot; of the <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-53" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">north</PLACE>'s nuclear programs.

&quot;We (have) made clear that once <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-17" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE> did that, we could move
on or move back to the comprehensive approach to <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>-<PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-18" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE>
relations that we had talked about before,&quot; he said.

<PLACE country="KR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19283410" id="Pl-36" latLong="37.000°N 127.500°E" type="COUNTRY">South Korea</PLACE>'s <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19820030" id="Pl-49" latLong="38.406°N 125.410°E" type="PPL">Munhwa</PLACE> Ilbo newspapers and others quoted unnamed <PLACE country="KR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19283410" id="Pl-37" latLong="37.000°N 127.500°E" predicative="true" type="COUNTRY">South
Korean</PLACE> government sources as saying <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19816541" id="Pl-32" latLong="39.019°N 125.755°E" state="KP-PYO" type="PPLC">Pyongyang</PLACE> also urged <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-43" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="US-DC" type="PPLC">Washington</PLACE>
not to hinder its efforts to establish and improve ties with <PLACE country="KR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19283417" id="Pl-50" latLong="37.566°N 127.000°E" state="KR-11" type="PPLC">Seoul</PLACE>

The <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-52" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North</PLACE>'s ruling Workers Party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, indicated
Sunday that <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-19" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE> wanted economic and political &quot;rewards&quot; from
the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> in return for the elimination of its nuclear
program.

Rodong called for a &quot;fair and equal&quot; footing in talks with the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" type="COUNTRY">United
States</PLACE>, blasting <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-44" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="US-DC" type="PPLC">Washington</PLACE> for insisting that there would be &quot;no
security of the system nor provision of rewards&quot; even if <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19816541" id="Pl-33" latLong="39.019°N 125.755°E" state="PYO" type="PPLC">Pyongyang</PLACE>
gave up its nuclear program.

It insisted <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-20" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE> could do &quot;everything&quot; to defend itself if the
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-10" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> &quot;legally guarantees no use of arms including nukes&quot;.
