The Daily Planet Ltd, about to become the first brothel to list on
the <PLACE country="AU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18443435" id="Pl-11" latLong="25.000°S 135.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Australian</PLACE> Stock Exchange, plans to follow up its May Day
launching by opening a "sex Disneyland" here, the <PLACE country="AU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18413156" id="Pl-14" latLong="37.817°S 144.967°E" state="VIC" type="PPLA">Melbourne</PLACE>-based
bordello announced Wednesday.

Chief executive Andrew Harris said the company was likely to abandon
plans to acquire a hotel in <PLACE country="AU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18396865" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.883°S 151.217°E" state="NSW" type="PPLA">Sydney</PLACE>'s <PLACE country="AU" form="NAM" id="Pl-18" state="NSW" type="RGN">Kings Cross</PLACE> red light district
and acquire another property three times the size in a better
location.

The Daily Planet raised 3.5 million dollars (2.2 million <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>) in its
initial public offering with one of the new 600 shareholders
acquiring 1.0 million dollars worth of shares.

Renowned <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1661757" id="Pl-19" latLong="34.098°N 118.326°W" state="CA" type="PPL">Hollywood</PLACE> madam Heidi Fleiss has been flown to <PLACE country="AU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18413156" id="Pl-15" latLong="37.817°S 144.967°E" state="VIC" type="PPLA">Melbourne</PLACE> as
guest of honour at Thursday's market debut and, according to Harris,
has already played a key role in attracting worldwide media attention
to the event.

"Heidi's ideas, her background, her knowledge have helped us a great
deal," he said. "The international novelty value with Heidi promoting
it has been massive -- these shares can go anywhere."

But it hasn't been an easy road to the <PLACE country="AU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18443435" id="Pl-12" latLong="25.000°S 135.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Australian</PLACE> Stock Exchange
since the idea was first mooted in 1994.

"The establishment did not want a brothel on the stock exchange,"
Harris said.

"It's only because we were the biggest and the best that we could
afford to do it.

"We have fought every institution, every law firm ... it's cost us a
fortune but now we're going on a massive expansion."

Harris said <PLACE country="AU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18396865" id="Pl-7" latLong="33.883°S 151.217°E" state="NSW" type="PPLA">Sydney</PLACE> was a more attractive option for the sex
Disneyland because its prostitution laws are less restrictive than
<PLACE country="AU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18413156" id="Pl-16" latLong="37.817°S 144.967°E" state="VIC" type="PPLA">Melbourne</PLACE>'s.

"Prostitution is completely decriminalised in <PLACE country="AU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18396865" id="Pl-8" latLong="33.883°S 151.217°E" state="NSW" type="PPLA">Sydney</PLACE> and we are going
to build a monster," he said.

"We want a complete one-stop adult venue -- we want a complete adult
venue with adult cinemas, adult shops... we have found much bigger
premises in a much better location to create a sex Disneyland."

The company is also considering franchising The Daily Planet within
<PLACE country="AU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18443435" id="Pl-13" latLong="25.000°S 135.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Australia</PLACE> with likely venues in <PLACE country="AU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18405325" id="Pl-21" latLong="31.933°S 115.833°E" state="WA" type="PPLA">Perth</PLACE>, <PLACE country="AU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18438272" id="Pl-22" latLong="27.500°S 153.017°E" state="QLD" type="PPLA">Brisbane</PLACE>, <PLACE country="AU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18396865" id="Pl-9" latLong="33.883°S 151.217°E" mod="W" state="NSW" type="PPLA">Sydney</PLACE>'s western
<PLACE country="AU" form="NOM" id="Pl-23" type="RGN">suburbs</PLACE> and a second venue in <PLACE country="AU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18413156" id="Pl-17" latLong="37.817°S 144.967°E" state="VIC" type="PPLA">Melbourne</PLACE>.

But The Daily Planet is saving its big plans for the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE>
where it is negotiating with two well-known <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> personalities to join
the board.

"The <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> is our major thrust," he said. "We want to build a
little city called <PLACE CTV="CITY" comment="hypothetical" country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-24" state="NV" type="PPL">Metropolis</PLACE> with a 150-200 room hotel in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780793" id="Pl-20" latLong="39.250°N 116.750°W" state="NV" type="CIVIL">Nevada</PLACE>."
