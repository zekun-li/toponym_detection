 CARLSON 
James, I'm sorry. I hear something in my ear. I'm afraid we are going to
have to interrupt. Our guests, just hold on a minute. We're going right
now to <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:424587" id="Pl-2" latLong="41.850°N 87.650°W" state="IL" type="PPL">Chicago</PLACE>, where police are having a briefing on today's workplace
shootings.(JOINED IN PROGRESS)


 PHIL CLINE, ACTING <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:424587" id="Pl-3" latLong="41.850°N 87.650°W" state="IL" type="PPL">CHICAGO</PLACE> POLICE SUPERINTENDENT 
And Chief Jim Mouer (ph), chief of patrol. This morning, at 8:36, a
former employee opened fire in the auto supply warehouse where he once
worked. As a result, six people have been murdered. The <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:424587" id="Pl-4" latLong="41.850°N 87.650°W" state="IL" type="PPL">Chicago</PLACE> Police
Department extends its sympathy to the families of the victims. And going
forward, our thoughts and prayers are with them as they cope with this
senseless tragedy. I would also like to praise the heroic police officers
who responded in a timely and professional manner to this tragedy. Let me
tell you what we know at this time, as our investigation continues. At
8:37 this morning, 9th District officers responded to a call of shots
fired at <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:424587" id="Pl-6" latLong="41.850°N 87.650°W" state="IL" type="PPL">Windy City</PLACE> Supply, located at <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-7" state="IL" type="ROAD">3912 South Wallace</PLACE> (ph). As
officers arrived, they encountered a witness who had been tied up by the
offender and escaped. He told the officers that a former employee had
shot five employees. And, at this time, officers attempted to enter the
building and the offender fired three shots at the officers. The officers
took cover behind their squad cars. And the offender came out and was
ordered to drop his gun. He refused and again fired at the officers. The
officers fired back. And the offender went back into the building.
Approximately one minute later, he came back out and again exchanged fire
with the police. Our HBT officers then arrived on the scene. And based on
the information that there was wounded citizens inside, they were ordered
to make an assault on the building. When the HBT officers entered the
building, the offender refused to drop his weapon and an HBT officer shot
him. At that time, the offender was handcuffed. Paramedics were already
on the scene. He was taken to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
Inside, there was six victims who were all -- four were pronounced at the
scene and two were pronounced at the hospital. Questions.


 QUESTION 
(OFF-MIKE) When was he fired or was he actually terminated (OFF-MIKE)


 CLINE 
According to management, he was fired approximately six months ago for
being a poor employee, late, not showing up to work, causing trouble at
work.


 QUESTION 
Had he come back, Phil, in the intervening days and weeks (OFF-MIKE)


 CLINE 
Through our interviews today, we know that there was some phone calls
with him and one of the owners. But no reports were ever made. And, like
I said, our investigation is still continuing as we speak here. We're not
aware of him having any in-person encounters with any of the former
people, but that could change as our interviews continue.


 QUESTION 
... any indication that some of the victims were targeted, or was it
random?


 CLINE 
Well, we know that he tied up the one victim inside and started killing
the other victims. So we're not sure why he didn't shoot that victim.
That's something that, hopefully, our investigation will uncover today.


 QUESTION 
Were the others tied up also?


 CLINE 
No, just the one person was tied up. That was it.


 QUESTION 
How many people work there?


 CLINE 
Well, on a given day, there should be nine people there. So eight were
there. And one employee was late because of the expressway conditions
with an accident this morning on the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-8" state="IL" type="ROAD">Eisenhower</PLACE>.


 QUESTION 
Six of the eight were killed.


 CLINE 
Six of the eight were killed. One was tied up inside, escaped. As he was
leaving, he encountered the other employee coming in. They're the ones
that both ran to <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-9" state="IL" type="ROAD">39th</PLACE> and <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-10" state="IL" type="ROAD">Wallace</PLACE> and called the police.


 QUESTION 
How did the person tied up get out?


 CLINE 
He got up and his hands were still tied behind his back, but was able to
get out.


 QUESTION 
And were the owner (OFF-MIKE) Who survived? (OFF- MIKE)


 CLINE 
Let me just tell you right now, we have contacted family members. We're
bringing them to the medical examiner's office. So we're not going to
identify anybody until we have positive identifications by the family
members.


 QUESTION 
Bill, can you tell us, did he (OFF-MIKE) these people (OFF-MIKE) or did
he just walk in and start mowing them down?


 CLINE 
From the scene, it appears that he went throughout the supply warehouse
shooting them. They weren't all in one section. They were in different
sections of the warehouse.


 QUESTION 
We understand they were shot in the head. Is that true?


 CLINE 
There again, once they're posted, we'll know exactly where all their
injuries were. But they all suffered fatal gunshot wounds, yes.


 QUESTION 
Did he make any statements that the witness heard while this was going
on?


 CLINE 
No. Not that we've been told so far.


 QUESTION 
Did he say anything to the officers?


 CLINE 
No.


 CLINE 
Yes. Right now, like I said, there are shell casings from the police
officers, shell casings from him at the scene. Our crime lab is going
through all that. We know he had at least one extra clip. It was a
Walther PP 380 semiautomatic pistol.


 QUESTION 
So he exchanged fire with police twice outside?


 CLINE 
Yes.


 QUESTION 
Before being shot himself.


 CLINE 
Right.


 CLINE 
He's been arrested a total of 12 times. And he has -- two times, he
was arrested for carrying a gun. Two times, he was arrested for
aggravated assault, four domestic batteries. And then the other ones are
traffic and other miscellaneous charges.


 CLINE 
He was a laborer working there. The building itself was very hard for our
HBT officers, because it's a warehouse.


 CARLSON 
OK, that's police in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:424587" id="Pl-5" latLong="41.850°N 87.650°W" state="IL" type="PPL">Chicago</PLACE> briefing the press on today's workplace
shootings there.
