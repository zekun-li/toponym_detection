 Bush has no shame (NPC) 

I really couldn't believe what I was watching while Bush put medals on
Talent, Franks and Bremer. Talent was in charge of the CIA when two of
the most costly intelligence failures in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> history happened --
not recognizing the Sept. 11 plot, and wrongly claiming that Saddam had
a stockpile of WMDs. Even people who mindlessly defend Bush's
policies, like wjb67, don't want to take responsibility for Talent --
they point out that he was originally appointed by Clinton. Franks was
in charge of the operation that was supposed to quickly go in, take
over <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000째N 44.000째E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, and then start moving our troops out rapidly -- at this
point I think we're going to see our troops over there at least through
the end of the decade. And Bremer decided to destroy the existing
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-3" latLong="33.000째N 44.000째E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> army, leaving it up to us and new recruits to try to impose
order.

This is just one more of those wierd, through-the-looking-glass moments
when Bush is trying to make something that at the very least has to be
seen as troubling, and that I consider an unmitigated failure, into a
success.

Troubling indeed....I will say go a little easier on Franks-not that he
deserves a medal- than the other two idiots though. He was not given
very much to work with--Cheney and Rummy are the ones to blame for the
screwed up war plans-of course I am sure they will get their medals
too. Bush is one of those guys that just sees how he wants to see, and
that is a terrible trait for a leader to have---rose-colored something
something I beleive it's called. Now THIS is an argument against Bush
I can throw my arms around!

His name is Georege TENET.

If you're going to spread your hatred about someone, spell their name right.

Good thing Bush is easy to spell......
