3. Bush Cabinet President Bush has just been elected to another term
in office, and he has already started to appoint new people to his
political cabinet as current members like Colin Powell and John
Ashcroft resign.  Who would you like to see appointed to his cabinet
next term?  Who are they, and why do you think they should be
appointed? If you were president, which national figures would you
appoint to your cabinet and why?  What new cabinet positions would you
create and who would fill them?


 A 
And the one that, oh what's the -- the guy that, um -- Tom Ridge just re-
resigned yesterday. He was another one that was -- I didn't really know
that much about him. I mean, I guess he was kind of the first -- one on
that homeland security or, in charge of that.  But I heard that they
were going to -- one of the possible candidates is the the guy he used
to be the chief of police of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-1" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL">New York</PLACE>.  Well that's somebody to me
that's going to have some good -- insight into, you know, what it takes
you know -- to -- keep a city secure. You know, because <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-2" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL">New York</PLACE>, I don't
know if you've ever been there


 B 
Yeah, I went there ((before))


 A 
has has has got some -- different rules from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780801" id="Pl-4" latLong="31.250°N 99.250°W" state="TX" type="CIVIL">Texas</PLACE> as far as -- you know
you know, running the <PLACE CTV="CITY" country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-6" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL">city</PLACE>.  I mean I, there's a lot lot more people
dense population up there than there is in in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780801" id="Pl-5" latLong="31.250°N 99.250°W" state="TX" type="CIVIL">Texas</PLACE> and they probably
would have uh the pol- uh the police chief would probably know -- well
what can work in like, airports or, you know, things, situations like
that. He was, he was a pretty good -- pretty smart person. But I, it
didn't -- I can't remember his name, but -- the, I saw an interview with
him, and -- how he, uh -- ran <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-3" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL">New York</PLACE> and uh -- you know, some of the -- ru-
you know, they changed some of the rules, uh -- uh, not rules, but the
way they -- uh


 B 
The management team


 A 
protected the <PLACE CTV="CITY" country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-7" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL">city</PLACE>. The the police kind of changed their tactics and,
because there was a lot of -- oh -- run down areas, and a lot of crime and
they, you know -- got -- cleaned it up, and and -- they passed some laws
that said, you know, you couldn't, I think it was like, um -- you know,
like homeless people that -- carrying -- uh -- you know, shopping carts, or
something like that, and it sounds -- small -- to outlaw that. But they
outlawed that because they said a lot of people were stealing stuff.
They'd stick them in the shopping carts and push them down the road.
You wouldn't know, oh, they're just a homeless person. Well they cut
that out and they found out -- it cut down on the theft.  Uh -- I guess
people -- hide them in their basket and -- or taking something and then
stick in their basket and the police never -- you know, bothered them.
Well, the homeless people -- I guess, they need their shopping cart, so
they kind of went elsewhere, so -- um -- I mean it's a small thing,  but
it was, they just figured out, they were -- you know, uh -- learning from
experience on what they need to do in the -- <PLACE CTV="CITY" country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:976772" id="Pl-8" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL">city</PLACE> and -- I think he would
be a good -- candidate for the Homeland Security,  running that.


 B 
But, eh, for the foreign po- uh this is all all what you are saying is
like, about the internal -- but what about the external policy or
something like that? Whom do you think would be suitable?


 A 
The what now policy?


 B 
Like, eh, foreign po- or international policy or external or


 A 
Mhm.


 B 
uh, whom do you think -- would be suitable for this position?


 A 
To run foreign policy?  Um -- like, uh -- well, it was -- Colin Powell was
Secretary, was he Secretary of State? Is that what that was?


 B 
Yeah.


 A 
And Condoleezza Rice is going to step into that position, the way I
understand it, uh.


 B 
Yeah, that's right.


 A 
Yes.  You know, she may be -- uh uh uh, you know, uh -- a uh Bush yes
person, you know, I don't know, uh


 B 
Yeah, so I I don't think this will change too much I mean.


 A 
well mo- most -- most -- aides to the President, if it was -- you know, I
guess when it was Clinton it was, they'd probably be kind of yes
people too, but, I mean they pick the person to -- you know, help them
and I guess they're going to have to have -- philosophies and and -- run
it the way they would or way they'd want, uh


 B 
Yeah, actually I agree with you. I think uh -- during, uh, Clinton time
uh -- the uh like international policy or the external policy was -- was
much better than -- uh what what is happening right now, so.  I think if
we took Bill Clin- Bill Clinton as like, as a foreign policy -- He he
would be he will do a very good job.  I I would say.


 A 
Mhm.


 B 
Uh, do you think there is uh -- some other, uh like -- positions has to be
has been -- has to be created, like uh -- for the next election.


 A 
I'm s- -- say that again. I didn't understand.


 B 
I mean, I mean, is there any other, eh, positions or -- Uh, like uh, has
to be created like the -- uh -- election. I mean -- uh, for example they
they made, uh -- a position for like, uh -- internal eh, security -- I I
think after, eh September eleventh


 A 
Mhm.


 B 
they created a position like that.  Do you think there is -- some other
position has eh have to be created?


 A 
I don't think so. I don't think you need -- uh -- you never know what's
go- going to happen, I mean um -- what could -- you know, there could be
something hap-
