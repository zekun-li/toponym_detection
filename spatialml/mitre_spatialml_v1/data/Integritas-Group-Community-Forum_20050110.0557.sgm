 Biography of Jo-Ann Bellucci 

My biography changed completely 5 years ago when I contracted a very
severe case of fibromyalga. Usually I say nothing about it although it
has severly limited my life, no truthly changed it completely! This
time I decided to just say it up front and go back and talk about the
good old days, when life was a kick!

I now live in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:613401" id="Pl-2" latLong="42.371°N 71.183°W" state="MA" type="PPL">Watertown</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:607926" id="Pl-1" latLong="42.250°N 71.500°W" state="MA" type="CIVIL">MA</PLACE>, 12 miles from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:618565" id="Pl-3" latLong="42.358°N 71.060°W" state="MA" type="PPLA">Boston</PLACE>'s Logan airport, in a
lovely two family house I bought as an investment with my boss, my 9
year old Yorkshire Terrier, Teddy! I just turned 50 years old this
Christmas. When I had a j.o.b. I ran a software company for a few years
and then started my own company, Pinnacle Business Enterprises and was
under a 5 year exclusive contract with PriceWaterhouoseCoopers doing a
lot of interesting things like Business Process Engineering, processes
but mostly people and the effect new process would have on them.
Showing them how to invite change into their lives because it freed
them from the mundanne tasks and allowed them to use their great
creativity instead of their backs. I'll get on to the more fun stuff
(read embarrassing, teasable stuff)in a minute but just one business
story.

Those of you in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1630543" id="Pl-5" latLong="31.000°N 92.000°W" state="LA" type="CIVIL">Louisianna</PLACE> are very familiar with what used to be The
Akzo Salt Mines. On a client visit one day, unexpectedly, they dressed
me up in safety equipment and ran me down the mine shaft. I mention
this because I never really got over, after that, how much we take
advantage of evryday things ...like the salt on our tables or the rock
salt that keeps the northern cities moving in the winter! After I
learned how to breath with my emergency apparatice I was driven around
to see the manufacturing sites. I'm sure we are all familiar with
those Yellow Tonka trucks little boys play with and move dirt from one
place to another....well just imagine an ENTIRE UNDERGROUND CITY with a
variety of those types of trucks (erath movers, backhoes etc) EXCEPT
the tires alone are 8 foot tall! Its then that I realized that life is
ever so much more then you can see on the surface in all aspects!

Ok Chris ... here comes the stuff you can pay me back with. I am an
excellent dancer, started before I could walk. I've studied ballet,
tap, toe, jazz and modern and studied opera singing for a while. Due to
the medications necessitated by my illness, I have lost 150 lbs
twice,and in between illnesses, I modelled for several of both trendy
and elegant boutique and department stores as well as did runway work.
One day I'll show you my portfolio.

I grew up in what at that time was rural <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780795" id="Pl-6" latLong="40.167°N 74.500°W" state="NJ" type="CIVIL">NJ</PLACE> and my father was an avid
hunter and sportsman. My father, way ahead of his time in his
thinking, was an equal oportunty thinker... that is why I can and love
to shoot skeet, was a champion archer as a child, learned to camp and
hike and drive a speedboat, kayack of course canoe and when I recover
Chris, I will join you white wather rafing because I have only done
level three but what an unbelievable rush!!

I love to craft, I knit, crochet, make furniture, paint and garden. I
consider myself and "ALL AMERICAN GIRL" when that wasn't a politically
incorrect phrase to use. I am single, and I teach religious education
to teenagers as a challenge and as service to God ... but mostly
because they are some of the most interesting, difficult people you can
teach ... but I love them and once you teach them, they are GOLD.

Both my houses, in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780795" id="Pl-7" latLong="40.167°N 74.500°W" state="NJ" type="CIVIL">NJ</PLACE> and <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:618565" id="Pl-4" latLong="42.358°N 71.060°W" state="MA" type="PPLA">Boston</PLACE> are always open to friends and those
who would be friends. And now I'll stop because I can see Chris
getting ready to give me the hook.
