A retired navy officer facing life in prison over a failed effort to
protect <PLACE form="NAM" id="Pl-14" type="RGN">Kurdish</PLACE> rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, told a court Thursday
he felt remorse for his part in the 1999 plot.

``I have a guilty conscience,'' Andonis Naxakis said during his
two-hour testimony.

Naxakis is one of 13 people on trial for bringing the fugitive
guerrilla leader to <PLACE country="GR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:20169939" id="Pl-3" latLong="39.000°N 22.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Greece</PLACE>. Ocalan was moved by the government to its
embassy compound in <PLACE country="KE" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17750169" id="Pl-6" latLong="1.000°N 38.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Kenya</PLACE>, where he was captured by <PLACE country="TR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19226169" id="Pl-7" latLong="39.000°N 35.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Turkish</PLACE>
commandos.

The retired <PLACE country="GR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:20169939" id="Pl-5" latLong="39.000°N 22.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Greek</PLACE> officer said he had been trying to get Ocalan to
<PLACE country="NL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17850115" id="Pl-10" latLong="52.500°N 5.750°E" type="COUNTRY">The Netherlands</PLACE>, home to a large <PLACE form="NAM" id="Pl-11" type="RGN">Kurdish</PLACE> community.

He claimed he had been manipulated by the government.

``I believe I was unwittingly used as bait for its disgraceful plan
... an organized move by the government to hand Ocalan over to
<PLACE country="TR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19226169" id="Pl-8" latLong="39.000°N 35.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Turkey</PLACE>,'' he said.

Naxakis and two of Ocalan's <PLACE form="NAM" id="Pl-12" type="RGN">Kurdish</PLACE> associates are being tried on
criminal charges of endangering national security. Ocalan, being
tried in absentia, was indicted for entering the <PLACE country="GR" form="NOM" id="Pl-15" latLong="39.000°N 22.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> illegally, a
misdemeanor.

Ocalan, leader of the <PLACE form="NAM" id="Pl-13" type="RGN">Kurdistan</PLACE> Workers Party, or PKK, is serving a
life sentence in <PLACE country="TR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19226169" id="Pl-9" latLong="39.000°N 35.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Turkey</PLACE> for leading a 15-year insurgency against the
<PLACE country="TR" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:19226169" id="Pl-16" latLong="39.000°N 35.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> that left 37,000 people dead.

He is being tried in <PLACE country="GR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:20169939" id="Pl-4" latLong="39.000°N 22.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Greece</PLACE> in absentia.
