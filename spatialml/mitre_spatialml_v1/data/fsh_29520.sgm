9. Elections Did you vote in the recent <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> Presidential election?
What did you think of the two candidates, George Bush and John Kerry?
What about the Vice Presidential candidates, Dick Cheney and John
Edwards?  What issues were most important to you in deciding who to
vote for?  If you didn't vote, why not?


 Obo 
Hello, my my name is Obo in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:971238" id="Pl-5" latLong="42.441°N 76.497°W" state="NY" type="PPL">Ithaca</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780796" id="Pl-6" latLong="43.000°N 75.500°W" state="NY" type="CIVIL">New York</PLACE>


 Ted 
Hi, my na- -- Hey, my name is Ted and I'm in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:296003" id="Pl-7" latLong="30.332°N 81.656°W" state="FL" type="PPL">Jacksonville</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:295478" id="Pl-8" latLong="28.750°N 82.500°W" state="FL" type="CIVIL">Florida</PLACE>.


 Obo 
Oh, nice, sounds like it's a lot warmer down there.


 Ted 
Oh yeah, sun's shining, it's a beautiful day.


 Obo 
Yeah, I guess the elections, ah -- basically, who did you vote for, and
the vice presidential candidates, and why, and I'll be honest with you


 Ted 
Yeah, go ahead.


 Obo 
I didn't vote for either of those.


 Ted 
Oh okay.


 Obo 
I did vote, but I I don't vote for the main party


 Ted 
Uh-huh.


 Obo 
ever, I usually try to stay out of the main party, because I think,
and this last election showed that both are very brutal.


 Ted 
It was


 Obo 
Um, yeah I think that the, uh


 Ted 
election.


 Obo 
Oh, I'm sorry.


 Ted 
It was a very brutal election.


 Obo 
Yeah, yeah, it's, yeah, you're absolutely, yeah, and I'm sorry, I
mean, if you want to add anything I'm sorry.


 Ted 
No no, go ahead, go ahead.


 Obo 
And, ah -- It's, it's just that -- Like, I I just, I think that the last
fifty years, the government has been mes- messed up by both these
parties, honestly.  Even maybe before that.  So, I, I usually do third
party -- um, and the way it was working this year was that the Democrats
really pushed to get Ralph Nader off the ballot


 Ted 
Yeah.  Yeah they did.


 Obo 
in every state, and um -- I mean, the Republicans sort of tried to play
like they were helping him out, but they knew they they didn't really
have to because they knew the Democrats were already doing more damage
to keep him off the ballot and they were successful, and for a
progressive party that was very brutal.


 Ted 
Mhm, it was.


 Obo 
And I wasn't really impressed by either of the two vice presidential
candidates, I know Dick Cheney seems to be running the show


 Ted 
You know?


 Obo 
and, ah -- I mean, and, and a lot of it has to do -- and then, I just
didn't know much, John Edwards seemed nice, but he just, you know, he
was just, he just got elected to the Senate,  and,  I wasn't really
familiar too much with hi- I mean, I think it's great that he got into
the vice presidential role, but -- again, it's the whole parties that
I'm really not really I don't like their policies.


 Ted 
Well, you kind of hit on some of my sentiments, um, I'm a fifty-year-
old black male,  and this was my first election that I participated
in.  And the reason was was that, ah, I'm retired Air Force -- and
before, ah, because I was in the military -- ah, didn't didn't really
think that my vote, um, counted one way or the other, that's that was
my thinking.  You know, I had a role to fulfill and regardless of how
I voted, uh, I was going to have to fulfill that role.  Um,


 Obo 
Yeah.


 Ted 
the, the situation, though, now that I'm out and, in the civilian
sector,  um,  I find that the economics as far as home -- is what I'm
most concerned with.  And because of the economic situation, I don't
think that's being addressed.  Yes, I feel very, very bad in regards
to the, ah, nine-eleven tragedy and terrorism and this kind of stuff


 Obo 
Mhm.


 Ted 
um, but I think so much attention is being paid to that -- that -- as you
mentioned, over the past fifty years, the two parties that run the
<PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> -- um, have definitely taken a, um -- streamlined approach to
whatever their agenda may be and not the will of the people.


 Obo 
You said it very well.  I totally, you coul- I couldn't have said it
better.


 Ted 
Now it's uh -- and as time goes on, you know, like, ah, what are we,
you know, headed for, what are we faced with?


 Obo 
I I


 Ted 
I mean, if we don't start looking inward and start taking care of
things at <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" type="COUNTRY">home</PLACE> -- uh, right now, yeah, we are the biggest power in the
world.  I heard a commentary by Rush Limbaugh, ah, the other day, and
the comment was made was that there always is going to be a big dog on
the street.  And right now I'm proud to be, ah, you know, behind the
<PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-10" type="COUNTRY">big dog</PLACE>, meaning the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE>.  If i- if if -- the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> is
not the big dog,  some power in the world is going to step up and be
just that.  We got so many crises and tension uh what do you -- hot
spots in the world,  that, uh,  instead of getting better, it seems to
be growing.  We got, uh, what is it, <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-11" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iran</PLACE>?  Uh, right behind <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-12" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>
there.  And then <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-13" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE>, which is, you know, always volatile.
Uh, you know, those situations are not getting any better, you know?


 Obo 
You're absolutely right, yes.


 Ted 
And as far as -- You know, I mean, what are we going to do?  We can- we
cannot -- police the whole world.  We, we truly cannot.
