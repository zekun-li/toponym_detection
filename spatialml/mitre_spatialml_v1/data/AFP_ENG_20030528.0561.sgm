Bankrupt energy giant Enron Corp is considering bringing legal action
against its own bankers for giving bad financial advice that helped
lead to its downfall, the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208991647" id="Pl-3" state="NY" type="ROAD">Wall Street</PLACE> Journal reported Wednesday.

The <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1381948" id="Pl-4" latLong="29.763°N 95.363°W" state="TX" type="PPL">Houston</PLACE> energy company, which has been the target of a slew of

motions in federal bankruptcy court in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:980190" id="Pl-5" latLong="44.352°N 75.917°W" state="NY" type="RGN">Manhattan</PLACE> in April, said the
daily.

It added that the move is part of a new push under the leadership of
new chief executive officer Stephen Cooper to settle all the
litigation involving Enron and its bankers, shareholders and
creditors.

Enron's principal bankers, including JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup,
and along with numerous other Enron advisers, have already been sued
by the company's shareholders for allegedly helping the company hide
debt, and they face investigations from regulators over their
involvement.

Besides JP Morgan and Citigroup, the other Enron advisers include
