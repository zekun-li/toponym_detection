<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-14" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> intelligence officials now believe <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-2" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE> is developing the

<PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-24" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>'s growing arsenal of missideS( potentially putting <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19753773" id="Pl-28" latLong="35.685°N 139.751°E" state="13" type="PPLC">Tokyo</PLACE> and
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-15" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> troops based in <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-29" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE> at risk, according to officials who have
received the intelligence reports.

In the assessment, which they have shared with <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-30" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE>, <PLACE country="KR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19283410" id="Pl-32" latLong="37.000°N 127.500°E" type="COUNTRY">South Korea</PLACE> and
other allies in recent weeks, officials at the Central Intelligence
Agency said that <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-16" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> satellites have identified a sophisticated new
nuclear testing site in an area called <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" id="Pl-35" type="RGN">Youngdoktong</PLACE>. At the site,
equipment has been set up to test conventional explosives that, when
detonated, could compress a plutonium core and set onfe nuclear
explosion.

[oMa intelligence officials believe that the existence of the testing
range is evidence that the country intends to manufacture much more
sophisticated weapons that would be light enough to put onto its
growing arsenal of medium- and long-range missiles. Previously,
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-17" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> officials had said they were uncertain whether <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-3" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE> had
received enough outside technical help to even attempt to make such a
``miniaturized'' nuclear warhead. The new testing capability would
suggest that the North Koreans are getting closer _ now, officials
said, the intelligence reports say they could do in in as little as a
year or less. But officials say there is no sure way of knowing that
they can until they actually test one.

Senior administration officials say that <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:532871" id="Pl-13" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="DC" type="PPLC">Washington</PLACE> has been trying
to convince Asiagent that it requires a unified diplomatic front to
force the <PLACE form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-25" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> to give up its weapons. The new intelligence is
apparently being marshaled to support the administration's argument.

According to officials who have been briefed on the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-18" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> reports,
conventional explosions simulating a nuclear detonation have been set
off at the testing site, which is near <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-4" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE>'s main nuclear
complex. <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-5" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE> has never tested a nuclear weapon, though the
CIA long ago estimated that it manufactured two crude devices in the
late 1980s or early 1990s.

<PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-6" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE>, unlike <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-36" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, has made no secret of its plan to develop
nuclear weapons. Now, administration officials say they fear that the
<PLACE form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-26" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> is on the verge of producing five or six new weapons, some of
which might be miniaturized.

 ``This would give them the range they never had before, and the
chance to spread their threat far beyond <PLACE country="KR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19283410" id="Pl-33" latLong="37.000°N 127.500°E" type="COUNTRY">South Korea</PLACE>,'' said one
senior <PLACE continent="AI" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:30009613" id="Pl-41" type="CONTINENT">Asian</PLACE> official, noting that approximately 60,000 <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-19" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> troops
are based in <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-31" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE>. ``It changes the dynamics of the problem.''

The new intelligence estimates provided to <PLACE continent="AI" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:30009613" id="Pl-42" type="CONTINENT">Asian</PLACE> allies, however,
left it unclear how quickly the <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-43" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North</PLACE> could produce the small
warheads. The worst-case estimate, officials say, is that they could
do so in less than a year.

(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-20" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> satellites have been watching <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-7" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korean</PLACE> nuclear activity
intently since late last year, when the <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-44" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North</PLACE> evicted international
inspectors. Those inspectors had stood guard over a collection of
8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods, which can be reprocessed into
weapons-grade plutonium.

In January the <PLACE form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-27" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> began to re-start its nuclear rexrOgessing
equipment, which had been mothballed for nearly a decade under a 1994
agreement with the Clinton administration. But according to <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-21" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE>
officials, it now appears that <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-8" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korean</PLACE> engineers ran into
technical problems in restarting the facilities. While intelligence
officials have reached no consensus, they told allies last week that
in the worst case, only a few hundred of the 8,000 rods had been
converted into plutonium. It would take 1,000 to 1,500 rods to make
enough plutonium for a weapon, experts say.O

``What we are told is that it would take perhaps six months after
that to produce a miniaturized warhead, and put it into one of the
missiles,'' said one senior official who has recently reviewed the
intelligence. ``But after <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-37" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, who knows how good those estimates
are?''

After the claims made about prohibited weapons in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-38" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, which have
not been found so far, skepticism about the quality of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-22" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE>
intelligence is widespread. And in the case of <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-9" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE>, as in
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-39" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, the immediacy of the threat depends on whose analysis seems
most compelling.

So far, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-23" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> intelligence has picked up almost no sign of the
telltale krypton gas that is released into the atmosphere when
nuclear fuel rods are converted into weapons-grade plutonium. This
has led some analysts to argue that the North Koreans may be farther
from producing a weapon than feared a few months ago.

But others note that trucks were seen carrying the rods out of their
normal storage area months ago, and it is unclear where they are _ or
even whether the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-46" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> is sniffing for the krypton gas in the
right place.

``We don't believe that the main reprocessing facility has been very
active,'' said one senior administration official in a recent
interview. ``But could there be a second reprocessor? No one knows
for sure.''

Without question, though, <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-10" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE>'s capabilities greatly outstrip
anything <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-40" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> has had in the past decade, and <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-11" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North Korea</PLACE>'s program
is probably several years ahead of <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-47" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iran</PLACE>'s.

President Bush and <PLACE country="KR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19283410" id="Pl-34" latLong="37.000°N 127.500°E" type="COUNTRY">South Korea</PLACE>'s new president, Roh Moo-h is unclear
whether they interpret the meaning of that phrase the same way. Bush
has said he wants a diplomatic solution to the problem, but would not
foreclose any option, including military options. Roh has said any
pre-emptive strike against the <PLACE country="KP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19818415" id="Pl-45" latLong="40.000°N 127.000°E" type="COUNTRY">North</PLACE>'s nuclear facilities could prove
disastrous.
