Some pictures. Well, Laith Kubba is an <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> exile who has family members
in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-3" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>. Mr. Kubba is a senior fellow at a think tank called the National
Endowment for Democracy. He is also the president of a group of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE>
exiles, a group called the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> National Group. He joins us now from
<PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17398111 NGA:-2601889" id="Pl-30" latLong="51.500Â°N 0.117Â°W" state="ENG" type="PPLC">London</PLACE> to talk about rebuilding his <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-21" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>. Mr. Kubba, first of all,
your thoughts as you've watched these scenes of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-24" latLong="33.339Â°N 44.394Â°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>, the Saddam
Hussein regime falling in the last day?


 LAITH KUBBA, PRESIDENT, <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">IRAQI</PLACE> NATIONAL GROUP 
It is a huge sigh of relief, because it could have been much worse and
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-25" latLong="33.339Â°N 44.394Â°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> could have been a war theater with more destruction to property.
And, obviously, there are four million people who could have suffered
more. So, there is a sigh of relief that it is not worse. But, obviously,
there is a great, great concern about the scenes that you've been showing
on television.


 WOODRUFF 
Are you talking to family members now in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-26" latLong="33.339Â°N 44.394Â°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> and around <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-7" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>? And, if
you are, how concerned are they about the lawlessness?


 KUBBA 
Well, not in the recent three or four days. There are no phone lines to
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-27" latLong="33.339Â°N 44.394Â°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>. In other parts of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-8" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, I received with great sadness the
killing of one close colleague, Saeed Abu Naji Abhuey (ph) in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897127 NGA:-3102873" id="Pl-32" latLong="31.992Â°N 44.351Â°E" state="NA" type="PPLA">Najaf</PLACE>. He
was not killed by former members of the Baath Party or the security of
the army, but by just a local organized group. So those signs to me are
worrying. People are sensing and feeling the lack of authority or the
power vacuum and are testing it. And the more they test, the more I think
they are claiming.


 WOODRUFF 
How difficult will it be to sort out who will next hold power in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-9" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>
after this transition period, however long it is, where the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-33" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> is in
charge?


 KUBBA 
Well, one needs to break down this process into various elements. Today,
there should be an authority. And it's very likely that the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-34" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> and the
<PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-2610495 IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-31" latLong="54.000Â°N 4.000Â°W" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> forces are the authority on land. And there ought to be
administration. And this ought to be primarily by Iraqis. But when it
comes to government, I think we really need to map out step by step how
to move from this power vacuum to the day we have elections. We need to
involve the U.N. We need to involve all <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-10" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> forces in the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-11" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>,
outside the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-22" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>. But we need to do it quickly, because every day
passes by with this vacuum, it's going to spell trouble.


 WOODRUFF 
Well, we know, Mr. Kubba, there are several <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-12" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> exiles groups competing
for influence. Is one of them going to have an advantage? And,
particularly, I have in mind the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> National Congress that Mr.
Chalabi, who was assisted by <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-35" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> forces in getting back into <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-14" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>?


 KUBBA 
I think it's one thing to gain fame and access to <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:531871 IGDB:532871" id="Pl-37" latLong="38.895Â°N 77.037Â°W" state="DC" type="PPLC">Washington</PLACE>. It's
totally another to gain legitimacy and functioning grounds inside <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-15" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>.
And I think plans must not be drawn in thin air out in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:531871 IGDB:532871" id="Pl-38" latLong="38.895Â°N 77.037Â°W" state="DC" type="PPLC">Washington</PLACE>. It
must really be drawn on the ground inside <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-16" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>. And there are 22 million
people there. It's not a void. It's not a vacuum. And I think all plans
must be anchored there in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-17" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> in its reality.


 WOODRUFF 
So does one group have an advantage over another now?


 KUBBA 
There are different groups who have advantage over others in different
parts of the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-23" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>. Unfortunately, we do not have a national group that
can appeal to Iraqis as Iraqis within a credible voice.This needs to be
constructed, maybe through a conference to be held in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-28" latLong="33.339Â°N 44.394Â°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>, where
representatives from provinces all over <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-18" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> need to participate, as well
as political groups. But we do not have a single group, a single
leadership or a single council yet.


 WOODRUFF 
We're talking with Laith Kubba, who is the president of a group of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-19" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE>
exiles. The group is called the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-20" latLong="33.000Â°N 44.000Â°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> National Group. Mr. Kubba, we thank
you so much for talking to us from <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17398111 NGA:-2601889" id="Pl-29" latLong="51.500Â°N 0.117Â°W" state="ENG" type="PPLC">London</PLACE>.


 KUBBA 
Thank you.


 WOODRUFF 
We appreciate it.


 KUBBA 
Thank you.


 WOODRUFF 
Here in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:531871 IGDB:532871" id="Pl-39" latLong="38.895Â°N 77.037Â°W" state="DC" type="PPLC">Washington</PLACE>, members of the House of Representatives come together
to support <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-36" type="COUNTRY">America</PLACE>'s armed forces. Up next: a live report on that
ceremony and the latest efforts to pass a spending bill to pay for the
war.
