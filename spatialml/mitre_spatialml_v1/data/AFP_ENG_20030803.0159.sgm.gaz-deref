The holy city of <PLACE CTV="CITY" country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897127 NGA:-3102873" id="Pl-3" latLong="31.992°N 44.351°E" state="NA" type="PPL">Najaf</PLACE>, power base of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-8" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>'s Shiite Muslim majority,
is locked in a silent battle between those prepared to cooperate with
the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-10" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>-led administration and those who champion resistance.

The struggle by supporters of firebrand cleric Moqtada Sadr to push
the religious hierarchy into a more antagonistic approach towards the
Americans has seen three attacks on mainstream clerics in the past
two weeks, sources say.

&quot;Such crimes are aimed at provoking disturbances in the <PLACE CTV="TOWN" country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897127 NGA:-3102873" id="Pl-16" latLong="31.992°N 44.351°E" state="NA" type="PPL">town</PLACE>, but the
people have ignored them,&quot; said a son of Ayatollah Mohammad Said
al-Hakim, one of Shiite Islam's top four clerics.

But these pressures &quot;won't make the Hawza change its policy&quot;,
Mohammad Hussein al-Hakim said, stressing that the hierarchy
continued to favour talks as the best way of ending the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-11" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>-led
occupation.

However, Sadr, who is himself scion of an illustrious family of
ayatollahs, has openly defied the hierarchy by condemning all contact
with <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-12" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> forces.

During the mainly weekly prayers in the nearby town of <PLACE CTV="TOWN" country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897411 NGA:-3102589" id="Pl-17" latLong="32.035°N 44.403°E" state="NA" type="PPL">Kufa</PLACE> Friday,
he demanded the withdrawal of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-13" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> troops.

As one of the most outspoken voices of Shiite protest against the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-14" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>
occupation, he said he was determined to defend the holy sites of
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897127 NGA:-3102873" id="Pl-4" latLong="31.992°N 44.351°E" state="NA" type="PPL">Najaf</PLACE> against the Americans, branding it the responsibility of all
Muslims in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-9" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>.

But demonstrators gathered in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897127 NGA:-3102873" id="Pl-5" latLong="31.992°N 44.351°E" state="NA" type="PPL">Najaf</PLACE> on Thursday and Friday to protest
against the wave of attacks against mainstream clerics and proclaim
their allegiance to the religious hierarchy.

A theology student, Amjad al-Azari, was beaten with the butt of a
rifle on Tuesday for refusing to drive armed men to Hakim junior's
house, a source close to the Hawza said.

Similarly, last Sunday, Sheikh Dia al-Modhaffar, a relative of
Ayatollah Hakim, was beaten black and blue in the street by unknown
assailants.

Supporters of Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, another of Shiite Islam's
leading clerics, have also been subject to attacks.

An official from his office, Ibrahim Layez, was admitted to hospital
with multiple stab wounds two weeks ago, although he is now said to
be out of danger.

These attacks have been accompanied by &quot;death threats&quot; against the
ayatollahs, said Hakim junior.

Officially, no complaints have been filed, but the ayatollah's son
blames those who see their only hope of power and influence in
&quot;chaos&quot;.

&quot;It must be an outsider, because the population is known for its
allegiance to the Hawza and respect for it is sacrosanct in the
<PLACE CTV="TOWN" country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897127 NGA:-3102873" id="Pl-18" latLong="31.992°N 44.351°E" state="NA" type="PPL">town</PLACE>,&quot; he said.

Instead, he pointed the finger at &quot;certain blemishes on the name of
Islam&quot; who collude with the media, in a clear reference to Sadr,
whose sermons are regularly featured on television.

But a spokesman for Sadr denied any role in the violence, dismissing
the allegations as &quot;prejudice&quot;.

&quot;Any attack against a member of the Hawza, be he a dignitary or a
simple student, is unacceptable,&quot; said Sheikh Mustafa Yaqubi.

Yaqubi defended Sadr's opposition to the Americans, although he
acknowledged it had little support among the tribes who still
dominate the countryside.

&quot;They think the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-15" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> presence gives them protection but we see the
occupation as more negative than positive. It is not acceptable to
justify the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-19" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> occupation in this way,&quot; he said.
