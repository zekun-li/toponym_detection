A state security court suspended a newspaper critical of the
government Saturday after convicting it of publishing religiously
inflammatory material, the newspaper's lawyer said.

The <PLACE country="SD" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19998013" id="Pl-2" latLong="15.588°N 32.534°E" state="KRT" type="PPLC">Khartoum</PLACE> Monitor may not appear for two months and must pay a
fine of 1 million <PLACE country="SD" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19985421" id="Pl-3" latLong="15.000°N 30.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Sudanese</PLACE> pounds (about <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>$400), lawyer Ngor Olang
Ngor told The Associated Press. Failure to pay the fine would result
in a two-month extension of the suspension.

The sentence was the latest in a series of state actions against the
Monitor, the only English language daily in <PLACE country="SD" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19985421" id="Pl-4" latLong="15.000°N 30.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Sudan</PLACE> and a leading
critic of conditions in the south of the <PLACE country="SD" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:19985421" id="Pl-12" latLong="15.000°N 30.000°E" mod="S" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>, where a civil war
has been waged for 20 years.

Ngor said the paper would pay the fine but it would also appeal the
verdict.

The court ruling stated that the verdict and sentence would be
submitted to the National Press Council, a government-appointed body,
for approval, Ngor said.

The secretary general of the National Press Council, Hashim el-Jazz,
did not answer repeated calls to his cell phone on Saturday.

The court convicted the paper of violating article 25 of the Press
Law, which prohibits the publication of material that defames
religion or incites religiously unacceptable activity.

The charges arose from letters-to-the-editor published last month
that dealt with religion. One letter claimed that alcohol was not
prohibited by Islam.

Earlier this week, security police detained the Monitor's managing
editor, Nhial Bol, for 24 hours. On his release, he was charged with
incitement of public discord for publishing the letters.

Christian minority.

In a separate action against the Monitor, security officials went to
its editorial offices on Thursday night and told the management that
it was being closed until it paid a fine of 15 million <PLACE country="SD" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19985421" id="Pl-6" latLong="15.000°N 30.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Sudanese</PLACE>
pounds (about <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-10" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>$6,000) that was outstanding from a court conviction
last year.

The Monitor did not appear Friday and its offices were closed.

In last year's trial, the paper was convicted of defaming the
government for publishing that trains running to and from southern
