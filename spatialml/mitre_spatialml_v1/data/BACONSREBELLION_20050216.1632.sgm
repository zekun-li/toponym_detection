The Senate Finance Committee today gutted the House of Delegates
proposed billion dollar transportation package in a move one observer
described as a 'bitch slapping.'

The House appropriated more money for transportation than the Senate.
How does a body that wants to raise taxes to pump more money into
transportation next year get to "bitch slap" more money now?

What is becoming abundantly clear is that it's either Chichester's
way or the highway (pun intended)

Tis a sad day for Dave Albo's law firm, which was counting on him to
push the abuser fees bill and bring them more clients. Can we have a
moment of silence?

If bitch slaps are administered to keep the 'ho servicing the
clients, who's the client here? Since the gubernatorial race in the fall
undoubtedly dominates all decisions from this point on, could it be a
client who must be serviced to serve November purposes? Could it be
those who will forego a little now, and are willing to give a lot before
Nobvember, in order to get a whole lot more in 2006?
