One of the rules of thumb that has guided my (limited) business
career from the beginning is that <PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18099327" id="Pl-2" latLong="35.000°N 105.000°E" type="COUNTRY">China</PLACE> is never as lucrative as it
looks. This assumption is based on about 150 years of economic history,
including several booms in interest and investment in <PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18099327" id="Pl-3" latLong="35.000°N 105.000°E" type="COUNTRY">China</PLACE>. Their
biggest problem: There's usually a 200-to-1 ratio of Nearly Starving
Peasant Laborers to Absurdly Well-Off Government Employees. And now it's
an iffier 100-to-1, since there are also rich private sector employees
and the labor force isn't quite so expendable. What they've been missing
for years was the real driver behind any consumer economy: Consumers.
Specifically, they didn't have a real middle class. That's changed in
the last twenty years, as increasing social mobility and a burst in
foreign demand has finally made <PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18099327" id="Pl-4" latLong="35.000°N 105.000°E" type="COUNTRY">China</PLACE> a genuine, rather than
theoretical, contender. And they've even supplied proof of their
economic viability, announcing that they've beaten <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-5" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE> for exports to
the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> .

If only I'd figured this out in early 2002, when their stock market
was by some stretch of the imagination cheap.

I dunno if you want anything to do with their stock market. For one,
its perforance last year was pretty dismal. More importantly, its a
structural nuthouse. Unfortunately, minority shareholder rights are
virtually non-existent, and excluding the dodgy financial statements
listed on the exchange, lots of times companies are more interested in
generating cash from an IPO then actually bothering with shareholder
value. This Economist article (not sure if registration is required,

Finally, the <PLACE country="CN" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18075535" id="Pl-7" latLong="31.222°N 121.458°E" state="31" type="CIVIL">Shanghai</PLACE> Composite on July, 1997 was trading at 1189.76.
As of January 27, 2005 it's sitting at 1225.89. That's an annualized
return of roughly .4%. The 5 year return is even worse
(http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=^SSEC&amp;t=5y). You haven't missed
much :)
