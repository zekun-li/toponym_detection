Joe Granville's Still At It

<TEXT>

Joseph Granville, the octogenarian technical analyst, has predicted a
precipitous decline in stock prices this year . I'm a little bearish,
myself (it always helps), but I've taken the liberty of checking some
alternate sources for Granville information , from which I get the
following incident: Granville's behavior easily attracted public
attention. His investment seminars were bizarre extravaganzas, sometimes
featuring a trained chimpanzee who could play Granville's theme song,
&quot;The Bagholder's Blues,&quot; on a piano. He once showed up at an investment
seminar dressed as Moses, wearing a crown and carrying tablets.
Granville made extravagant claims for his forecasting ability. He said
he could forecast earthquakes and once claimed to have predicted six of
the past seven major world quakes. He was quoted by Time magazine as
saying, &quot;I don't think that I will ever make a serious mistake in the
stock market for the rest of my life,&quot; and he predicted that he would
win the Nobel Prize in economics .

Sounds like a paragon of stability and common sense to me!
