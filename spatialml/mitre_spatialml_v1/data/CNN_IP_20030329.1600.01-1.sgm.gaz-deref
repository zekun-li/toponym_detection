We're going to go quickly to northern <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-1" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="N" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> now where we find CNN
correspondent Ben Wedeman. There's been some action in that <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="N" type="COUNTRY">area</PLACE>. Nick
(ph) - I mean - I'm sorry. Ben, we can make you out just barely but tell
us what you've been seeing.


 BEN WEDEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT 
Yes. Judy, you're seeing us through the night scope because basically for
the last hour we've been watching as this <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-19" type="MTS">ridge</PLACE> behind me in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3105002 IGDB:16894998" id="Pl-14" latLong="36.264°N 43.648°E" state="TS" type="PPL">Kalak</PLACE> which
of course is the front line between <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> and <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208909932" id="Pl-16" type="RGN">Kurdish</PLACE> (ph) forces, we've
been watching as planes, planes we can hear but cannot see, have been
bombing the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-20" type="MTS">ridge</PLACE> line behind us. Five huge explosions within the space
of less than an hour as these planes drop these massive bombs on the
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-3" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> positions behind us. Not just <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> positions behind us, in
addition to that in the direction of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897344 NGA:-3102656" id="Pl-11" latLong="36.335°N 43.119°E" state="NI" type="PPLA">Mosul</PLACE> as well which is a major
northern <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="N" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> <PLACE CTV="CITY" country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897344 NGA:-3102656" id="Pl-17" latLong="36.335°N 43.119°E" state="NI" type="PPLA">city</PLACE> <SIGNAL id="S-1">about 28 miles</SIGNAL> to <SIGNAL id="S-2">the west</SIGNAL> of me. We've also seen
some massive blasts to the south as well so it appears that this bombing
in this area continues and we have really seen the most intense bombing
of the war in this area in the last 24 hours. Judy ...


 WOODRUFF 
Ben, what is your best understanding of what it is on the ground that the
coalition forces are going after there?


 WEDEMAN 
Well, basically on the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-21" type="MTS">ridge</PLACE> itself it is the most forward <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> army
positions and we've been watching them very closely for the last month
prior to the war to the outbreak of the war and basically these are the
positions that control this entire <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-23" type="RGN">valley</PLACE>. Up there they have heavy
machine guns. They have mortars. They have anti-tank guns, hundreds of
men along this very long <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" id="Pl-22" type="MTS">ridge</PLACE> that basically runs from the north to the
south. In addition to that, we know that further back behind those lines
in the direction of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897344 NGA:-3102656" id="Pl-12" latLong="36.335°N 43.119°E" state="NI" type="PPLA">Mosul</PLACE> there is heavy artillery and tanks as well,
this according to the people here in this area, the local Kurds who have
been going across the lines for many years basically engaged in
smuggling. Now precisely what they're hitting to the south of us is
unclear but my understanding is that there are further <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-7" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> positions in
that direction as well. Judy ...

Ben Wedeman describing coalition hits in the area where he is, the town
of <PLACE CTV="TOWN" country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3105002 IGDB:16894998" id="Pl-15" latLong="36.264°N 43.648°E" state="TS" type="PPL">Kalak</PLACE> in northern <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-8" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="N" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>. He just called in and we wanted to get this
report to you right away. Ben, very - we thank you very much for that and
we'll be coming back to you as the night - as the night wears on. We're
getting close to the bottom of the hour. We're going to get some
headlines at the hour right now with Heidi Collins.
