You may remember Pablo Paredes from an earlier posting of mine. He is
the coward who after volunteering for the Navy decided he doesn't want
to serve in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-1" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> so he went AWOL all the while getting as much press as
possible from his Socialist buddies.

Well, he was " surprised " yesterday when he was formally charged
with AWOL and Missing A Movement (what took them so long?):

Petty Officer 3rd Class Pablo E. Paredes decided to protest the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>
war by not sailing with his ship when it left <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1662377" id="Pl-3" latLong="32.715°N 117.156°W" state="CA" type="PPL">San Diego</PLACE> Harbor on Dec.
6.

Yesterday, the Navy decided to charge Paredes, 23, with being absent
without leave and missing movement, charges that could send him to
military prison for as long as a year and limit his employment options.

The action by the Navy surprised Paredes, who made headlines and drew
supporters and critics with his stance.

"I showed up at the base expecting to hear whether the local Navy
command had approved my conscientious objector status. Instead I was
read the charges against," said Paredes, who is on temporary duty at
Naval Base <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1662377" id="Pl-4" latLong="32.715°N 117.156°W" state="CA" type="PPL">San Diego</PLACE>.

This guy is in for an even bigger surprise once he gets his just
deserts. Hopefully he rots in prison for the maximum which is one year
in jail. Plus tack on forfeiture of pay, reduction in rank and a
bad-conduct discharge. Guess he can get a job as a secretary for
A.N.S.W.E.R. and his other buddies, doubt many will be hiring a shitbird
who has a Big Chicken Dinner on his record.

Thanks to Citizen Smash on the heads up and for doing such a great
job of holding this coward accountable.
