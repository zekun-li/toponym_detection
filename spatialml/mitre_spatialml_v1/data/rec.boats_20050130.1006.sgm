 OT: Republican election standards 

Here on the left edge of the <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" mod="W" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>, we have a unique perspective on
election standards.

In <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, an election takes place in which one of the three major
forces vying for control of the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-10" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> opts out. A few people will
turn out and elect somebody. It is hailed as the greatest triumph of
democracy since the defeat of Imperial <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-9" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japan</PLACE>.

In <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780804" id="Pl-11" latLong="47.500°N 120.500°W" state="WA" type="CIVIL">Washington State</PLACE>, our governor's race may be undecided for months to
come. Following the election and recount process exactly as outlined in
our <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:1780804" id="Pl-12" latLong="47.500°N 120.500°W" state="WA" type="CIVIL">state</PLACE> constitution, the democratic candidate won by a margin of
less than 200 votes. With roughly three million votes cast in the race,
the margin of victory was a few ten thousands of one percent or some
such microscopic amount. For all intents and purposes it was a tie- but
somebody had to end up with a few more votes and this time around it
was the demos.

The same group of people who have said "even if some regions are too
unsafe for people to go to the polls and even if large portions of the
population will not recognize the legitimacy of the outcome, some
election is better than no election, and it's a great day for
democracy!"...........are suing to overthrow the results of the
governor's election is <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780804" id="Pl-13" latLong="47.500°N 120.500°W" state="WA" type="CIVIL">Washington State</PLACE> because there were some
"errors" in the process. (They hollered "fraud" until they got to
court, but unable to find any evidence with which to substantiate that
charge they have backed down to "errors".)

So the standards are: Any old process halfway resembling an election is
just diddly dandy in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-3" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, but we won't accept the results of a free
and fair election in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780804" id="Pl-14" latLong="47.500°N 120.500°W" state="WA" type="CIVIL">Washington State</PLACE> because there may have been a
human error rate of 0.0000001 percent.
In <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780804" id="Pl-15" latLong="47.500°N 120.500°W" state="WA" type="CIVIL">Washington State</PLACE>, the election has to be not only free and fair, but
also "perfect". (Of course, the Republicans would have thought the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780804" id="Pl-16" latLong="47.500°N 120.500°W" state="WA" type="CIVIL">WA
State</PLACE> election *was* perfect, had their candidate
held the same 100 and some vote margin when all the smoke finally
cleared).
Funny how the standards change, and so easily, depending on agenda.

We have seen our <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:1780804" id="Pl-17" latLong="47.500°N 120.500°W" state="WA" type="CIVIL">state</PLACE>'s standards. Keep recounting the votes until you get
the results you want and if you need to go "find" some more votes in a
warehouse, in a box, hidden behind some other boxes.

    

This is too funny. The ones that are "opting" out are in one of three
protected classes within <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>. The protected classes are Kurd's, Sunni's and
Women.

    

only vote that ends in a tie is where both sides have the exact same
number of votes. This didn't happen in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780804" id="Pl-18" latLong="47.500°N 120.500°W" state="WA" type="CIVIL">Washington State</PLACE>. It took multiple
recounts before the vote tabulation was determined to be credible by the
Democrats.

    

Wasn't it <PLACE country="US" county="King County" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1532933" id="Pl-19" latLong="47.467°N 121.817°W" state="WA">King County</PLACE> that had "counted" more votes than registered voters.
Please explain how this happens. It seems that the evidence of irregularity
in the voting process is extremely apparent.

    

Yes, it is funny isn't it?

I'm a Democrat, a liberal and probably whole bunch of other labels that you
can pin on me. I'm always glad to see people gain the opportunity to change
their government from a dictatorship to a democracy. Everyone, everywhere
should have the basic right to elect their government.

The problem with this election is that no matter what happens the results
are going to be tainted and questionable. Think about this objectively
(forget the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-20" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> is involved), if a foreign country invaded another and set up
elections, wouldn't a reasonable person question the validity of the
election results? Let's assign some names. Say it's 1942, and the <PLACE country="DE" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18224345" id="Pl-21" latLong="51.500°N 10.500°E" type="COUNTRY">German</PLACE>
occupiers in <PLACE country="NL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17850115" id="Pl-22" latLong="52.500°N 5.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Holland</PLACE> have set up elections with <PLACE country="NL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17850115" id="Pl-23" latLong="52.500°N 5.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Dutch</PLACE> candidates. Well, not
really candidates, but political parties -- you'll be told who the
candidates were later. Would you say the results are valid?

Even if you, John H, believe the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-24" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> held impartial elections in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, don't
you think the rest of the world will find the results invalid, or least
suspect?

If Lou Dobbs, on CNN, at 6:10 Eastern, can say, "This election was a
success by any measure," that's good enough for me.

Not even Chris (Kerry's my man) Mathews could find any real fault with
the outcome. Our soldiers weren'e even close to the polls. Hell, they
couldn't even see the polls in most places, so the intimidation
bullshit is just that. Even Brian Williams, when questioned by Chris,
had to admit that he saw nothing to show <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-25" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> intimidation. (You could
tell it was killing Brian to have to admit that!)

Of course,you probably know better since you were there, right?

Here, go read something from people who are there:

If you look closely, you'll even find some negatives to gloat over.

You have to start somewhere and this election is to get a legislative body
to write a constitution for <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>. The next election will be the one with
more legitimacy. Sounds like how our <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-34" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> started doesn't it?

Sorry about my hard ass attitude!

The <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-26" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> soldiers were purposely kept well away from the polls during
the time the polls were open. They were the outer of three concentric
security rings, with the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-7" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> police and Army occupying the closest
two rings.

I watched a lot (but not all, of course) of the news on most of the
different channels, staying up until 5 am (like a real dummy!). I
didn't see one instance of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-27" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> soldiers at polling places. I *did* see
a lot of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-8" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> soldiers. Except for the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-28" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> flag on the shoulder and
the different weapons, they look pretty much the same. Hell, I noticed
that some of the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-29" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> soldiers were carrying AK's in one place!
