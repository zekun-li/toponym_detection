<PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-1456928 IGDB:18543072" id="Pl-1" latLong="48.867°N 2.333°E" state="75" type="PPLC">Paris</PLACE> hospital last week, after a lot of controversy surrounding his
illness and death.  What do you think caused his illness, and could it
have been something malicious (like poisoning)?  What do you think of
<PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725 NGA:-780275" id="Pl-2" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE>'s policies surrounding Arafat's illness and death?  Should
President Bush or a senior <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-11" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> official have attended Arafat's funeral?
Should <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725 NGA:-780275" id="Pl-3" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> have let Arafat be buried in <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19202908 NGA:-797092" id="Pl-9" latLong="31.767°N 35.233°E" state="JM" type="PPL">Jerusalem</PLACE>?


 Marco 
Hello, th- I'm Marco from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779784 IGDB:1780784" id="Pl-15" latLong="40.000°N 89.250°W" state="IL" type="CIVIL">Illinois</PLACE>.


 Mike 
Hi, I'm Mike from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779795 IGDB:1780795" id="Pl-16" latLong="40.167°N 74.500°W" state="NJ" type="CIVIL">New Jersey</PLACE>.


 Marco 
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779795 IGDB:1780795" id="Pl-17" latLong="40.167°N 74.500°W" state="NJ" type="CIVIL">New Jersey</PLACE>. How are you doing, Mike?


 Mike 
Pretty good. How's it going?


 Marco 
Pretty good.  Pretty good.


 Mike 
So- so what do you think?


 Marco 
Well, I'm think-


 Mike 
How about you start.


 Marco 
Yeah, okay, um, ((lot of question)) -- and, um,  I- I don't think it was
poisoning, even though I haven't read -- a lot of articles about it. I
think-


 Mike 
He- he was old. I mean-


 Marco 
Y- he was old, yeah.  And- -- and that- I- I didn't realize he wasn't
allowed to be buried in <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19202908 NGA:-797092" id="Pl-10" latLong="31.767°N 35.233°E" state="JM" type="PPL">Jerusalem</PLACE>, which-


 Mike 
Yeah, but a lot of that has to do with things that he's done.


 Marco 
Yeah.


 Mike 
He's- I mean, like, you know, let's- i- -- for- for all he did in his
later years, eh, Yasser Arafat was responsible for -- a good chunk of
al- you know, a lot of -- Israeli dying -- i- you know.  He basically, eh,
i- I'm completely torn on the whole thing. I mean, on one hand -- I
think it was kind of wrong that -- that -- you know, the ~UN just kind of
went in and said, hey, you know, guess what?  You know, we're- we're
you know, this is <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725 NGA:-780275" id="Pl-4" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> now, state of <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725 NGA:-780275" id="Pl-5" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE>.  And basically what
they did was they carved up the <PLACE form="NOM" id="Pl-18" type="RGN">region</PLACE> and- -- without any regard to,
you know, tribal -- animosity really, is really what it boils down to,


 Marco 
Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.


 Mike 
um.  You know, then it th- it was there,  he had to try to maintain
the status quo -- but they bred -- people like Yasser Arafat, I mean,  if
it -- if it wasn't for the stupidity of the United Nations,  people like
Yasser Yara- Arafat w- probably would've never even gotten off the
ground,  you know.


 Marco 
How how did the United Nations, uh,  Arafat in power, or help?


 Mike 
Well, in other words eh, in other -- when -- after World War Two when they
when -- basically the state of <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725 NGA:-780275" id="Pl-6" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> was formed


 Marco 
Mhm.


 Mike 
in f- uh, nineteen forty eight, I think it was.


 Marco 
Yeah.


 Mike 
Um,  you know, you- e- -- granted, you know, there were there were
Jewish people already living there,  but -- all the Jewish people
started going there and they j- basically just- you know, they just
took over.  And- and


 Marco 
Yeah.


 Mike 
in in a region where,  uh, you know,  y- you know, we live in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-12" type="COUNTRY">America</PLACE>.
It's like coup- you know, f- our <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-19" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>'s a couple hundred years old,
we got a couple of gripes going back to, you know, what, seventeen
seventy six,


 Marco 
Yeah.


 Mike 
there it goes,  you know, thous- it's like the Hatfields and the
McCoys. They're fi- they don't even know why they're fighting anymore.
They just they hate each other -- and they're always going to hate each
other -- and it doesn't matter who started it,  but -- i- you know,
somebody eh, th- somebody's in always intent on winning.  And it's and
it's it's you know,  a war of attrition. Nobody wins. It's either,
you know,  you may kill me, but I'm going to kill all of you before-
y- you know what I mean? It's just i- i- it's stupid. The whole
thing's stupid. And a guy like Yasser Arafat,


 Marco 
Yeah.  Yeah.


 Mike 
he was a terrorist.  In in the sixties -- in the mid sixties an- and and
a- you know, on into- -- you know, through the mid eighties -- the guy was
a terrorist.


 Marco 
So, let us let us not forget that when <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725 NGA:-780275" id="Pl-7" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israel</PLACE> was -- formed -- and they
were,  um,  the -- the Israelis for not feeling -- like they had a
legitimate -- right -- some of the land or that -- land wasn't, um,
rightfully theirs. There were -- two very strong -- militant groups that
were <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725 NGA:-780275" id="Pl-20" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israeli</PLACE> and they -- committed a lot of terrorist acts,


 Mike 
Oh, the yeah, the Zionists. Abso- absolutely.


 Marco 
much -- Yeah.  So, I mean, i- -- you know,  uh, how we consider -- Arafat a
terrorist,  we also should consider that -- could've been, in some ways,
a reaction to some of the terrorism that was -- initially -- committed by
the Israelis.


 Mike 
Absolutely. I'm not believe me, I'm not I'm not excusing -- anybody -- but
for the purpose I I mean, the way I see it is you know, I guess for
the purposes of the conversation th- -- that they want to hear,


 Marco 
Yeah.


 Mike 
y- you got to kind of have to put that as y- -- i- it's kind of like -- do
if that's the case, do two wrongs really make a right?  You know what
I mean?


 Marco 
But if Arafat hadn't been I don't know if he's -- directly -- been linked
to Hamas' acts,  uh,  but he was put in a -- pretty -- sticky situation
having to negotiate -- the militants of -- <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-13" type="COUNTRY">Palestine</PLACE> -- the international
leaders -- and if it if Hara- Arafat hadn't -- somehow appeased -- the
Hamas groups or the <PLACE country="PS" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208674239" id="Pl-14" type="COUNTRY">Palestinian</PLACE> militants,  then -- he would've been
kicked out,  overthrown -- by- -- by the Palestinians.


 Mike 
Oh, forget about kicked out or overthrown, he would've been killed.
That's-that's how it works over there.


 Marco 
Yeah. Yeah.  Exactly.  Well, it it's not really Arafat -- as an
individual, I think it's just -- whatever leader -- is -- placed in the
position of-


 Mike 
He was he was basically -- I mean, I've read I've read articles an- and-
and- and -- stories that basically have linked him to the to the to the
<PLACE country="DE" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18170851 NGA:-1829149" id="Pl-21" latLong="48.150°N 11.583°E" state="BY" type="CIVIL">Munich</PLACE> -- massacre -- th- you know, the <PLACE country="DE" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18170851 NGA:-1829149" id="Pl-22" latLong="48.150°N 11.583°E" state="BY" type="CIVIL">Munich</PLACE> Olympic massacre th- the
Is- the <PLACE country="IL" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19219725 NGA:-780275" id="Pl-8" latLong="31.500°N 34.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Israeli</PLACE> team. It- -- the the problem is -- what he did -- back way
back when


 Marco 
Uh-huh.


 Mike 
will -- f- forever tarnish anything that he did -- in his later years.
Like like you said, bringing the groups together but the reason that
he was able to bring them together is because he was once one of them.
