Anyone who has spent any time in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779803 IGDB:1780803" id="Pl-1" latLong="37.500°N 78.500°W" mod="N" state="VA" type="CIVIL">NVA</PLACE> over the last 40 years is
familiar with the Giant grocery store chain. When the chain passed from
its private owners a few years ago, problems began. These problems
multiplied when the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208919220" id="Pl-3" type="RGN">New England</PLACE> chain Stop n' Shop acquired Giant. Add
new competition--Food Lion, Harris Teeter, and Wegman's--and loyalty to
Giant, once an article of faith, is dissipating. It's a cautionary tale
for business and for any long-standing organization seeking to change.

I'm new to this area (1 year) so I can't really comment on Giant.
Seems like an ok store...I prefer Harris Teeter.

Now Ukrops! That's a well run enterprise.

We Richmonders, we do love our Ukrops! We're fiercely loyal.

I worked there as a youngster many years back. Bagged groceries. And
I remember one day they had a dozen <PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770 NGA:-231230" id="Pl-6" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">japanese</PLACE> businessmen touring the
