 DAVIS 
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1496841 IGDB:1497841" id="Pl-6" latLong="36.819°N 76.275°W" state="VA" type="PPL">Chesapeake</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="TIPSTER:126100 IGDB:30126100" id="Pl-3" latLong="37.500°N 78.500°W" state="VA" type="CIVIL">Virginia</PLACE> Mayor William Ward says, trouble is coming to my
town. The mayor and others in this community are worried about their
tranquil town. <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1496841 IGDB:1497841" id="Pl-7" latLong="36.819°N 76.275°W" state="VA" type="PPL">Chesapeake</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="TIPSTER:126100 IGDB:30126100" id="Pl-4" latLong="37.500°N 78.500°W" state="VA" type="CIVIL">Virginia</PLACE> will be trampled by a big murder
trial media event. Welcome back. We're ON THE STORY. That's a town of
about 200,000. And in fact, the courthouse is new, it's beautiful, but it
has one way in and one way out. And officials were telling me, they can't
even get the people in for traffic court without a line in the mornings.
What are they going to do when hundreds of media, like us, are camped
outside waiting to get into that trial? It is going to be a log jam
according to the <PLACE CTV="CITY" country="US" form="NOM" gazref="USGS:1496841 IGDB:1497841" id="Pl-10" latLong="36.819°N 76.275°W" state="VA" type="PPL">city</PLACE>.


 STARR 
Well, did this <PLACE CTV="TOWN" country="US" form="NOM" gazref="USGS:1496841 IGDB:1497841" id="Pl-11" latLong="36.819°N 76.275°W" state="VA" type="PPL">town</PLACE> get a vote in this? You know, did they volunteer for
this kind of thing?


 DAVIS 
Well, the judge, Judge Jane Marivrausha (ph) of <PLACE country="US" county="Fairfax County" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1498476 IGDB:1499476" id="Pl-12" latLong="38.846°N 77.307°W" state="VA" type="CIVIL">Fairfax County</PLACE> went
shopping. She looked there, she looked at <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1501261 USGS:1500261" id="Pl-13" latLong="36.853°N 75.978°W" state="VA" type="PPL">Virginia Beach</PLACE>, and what it
boiled down to is that the <PLACE CTV="CITY" country="US" form="NOM" gazref="USGS:1496841 IGDB:1497841" id="Pl-14" latLong="36.819°N 76.275°W" state="VA" type="PPL">city</PLACE> lobbied do not bring this trial here and
they didn't win, and they don't have a choice. It's theirs, and they are
going to get it come November. That's it.


 STARR 
This could be coming to your town next.


 DAVIS 
It could be. Well, that's very interesting, because in fact, John
Muhammad, Malvo's alleged accomplice, has also asked for a change of
venue. We could see that going on maybe at the same time. Muhammad's
trial scheduled for October; Malvo for November. But it depends how long
that first one goes. We could have them both happening at the same time.
Will they be both be in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1496841 IGDB:1497841" id="Pl-8" latLong="36.819°N 76.275°W" state="VA" type="PPL">Chesapeake</PLACE>? I don't know.


 BASH 
This is obviously something that the defense was asking for. They wanted
it to be moved, because they didn't think that they could get a fair jury
in the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:531871 IGDB:532871" id="Pl-15" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="DC" type="PPL">Washington</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1702382 IGDB:1703382" id="Pl-18" latLong="38.917°N 77.001°W" state="DC" type="CIVIL">D.C.</PLACE> area, but isn't it something that the prosecution
might not be too unhappy about, because if he were convicted in
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:531871 IGDB:532871" id="Pl-16" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="DC" type="PPL">Washington</PLACE>, it would be sort of you would think top of the list for the
appeal for the defense. This way, it's harder to make the argument that
he didn't get a fair trial.


 DAVIS 
It does take away one of the possible points of appeal, if they do grant
him a change of venue, and the judge really was saying that it's only
fair here. Look at the publicity you have had. Also, you have a book
coming out by Chief Charles Moose. That's coming out mid-September, and
both of these lawyers in both of these cases have worried that that may
somehow be read by people in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="TIPSTER:126100 IGDB:30126100" id="Pl-5" latLong="37.500°N 78.500°W" state="VA" type="CIVIL">Virginia</PLACE> and that could somehow taint a jury
pool, as well. In fact, Muhammad's lawyer filed with in federal court
asking the federal judge, please delay the coming of that book in
September. Make it come after the trial, because we're worried about
that. We want to get a fair trial here.


 STARR 
This Chief Moose book is still really big news, at least here in the
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:531871 IGDB:532871" id="Pl-17" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="DC" type="PPL">Washington</PLACE> Metropolitan Area. A lot of people have a lot of opinions
about it. Have any of the families of the victims of the snipers spoken
about their feelings about Chief Moose making money on this book, off
this tragedy?


 DAVIS 
Well, he is billing it as an inside story. This is his life. But lawyers
are saying, well, wait a second, it's going to be a lot more than just
his life. It's going to be about what happened, and the case and how they
tracked these two alleged murderers down. But yes, there are members of
families, some of them saying, we really think this is not a good move on
the part of Chief Moose. Of course he has a right to go out and write a
book, but can't he wait, at least a little while, until at least the
trial gets under way? They don't want there to be any chance of tainting
the jury as well. They want a conviction if indeed these two are found
guilty.


 STARR 
Because, of course, I mean, I think it's the case that Chief Moose
singlehandedly didn't solve the case.


 DAVIS 
It was an FBI involvement, as well. Absolutely. Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, a large panoply of officials who were involved in solving this.
You're right. So it was a multipronged effort on all fronts.


 STARR 
So it should be a really interesting fall here in the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:531871 IGDB:532871" id="Pl-19" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="DC" type="PPL">Metropolitan area</PLACE>.


 DAVIS 
Oh, it's going to be wild, that's for sure.


 STARR
