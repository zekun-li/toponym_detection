 Say it aint so: RCA sold to Chinese company? 

Heard it said that RCA/Thomson TV brand has been sold
to some Chinese company. :-(

Is this a new thing, and the company has been bought?

Because the "RCA" name had been rented out by Thompson in recent
years for various things, the same way you see "Philco" radios
being sold on late night infommericals.

Thomson has gone into a joint venture with its Chinese subsidiary to
make consumer electronic products in China. The new joint venture is
called TTE. The engineers I know in Indianapolis say it is a good thing
for them. They will still be designing most of the sets for the US
market in Indy. This is a global operation and the sets get sold all
over the world. The company will be based in China as far as I can tell.

I think Thomson will be a minority share holder.

If what you are all after is RCA being a US company, that has not been
true since GE sold it to the French company, Thomson, almost 19 years ago.

Wasn't most RCA stuff over the years coming from Japan and Taiwan
anyway? I'll bet the components were. Sadly the U.S. lost the battle
when Japan dumped cheap color TV's on the market in the early 70's,
cheaper than what they cost to build. Zenith made great sets in Chicago
(?) but price took them out along with many others.

I always had trouble with RCA sets, and their service tried to rip me
off. Them "Oh you needed a new Horiz board", Me "but the thing left the
house with a horizontal line"???

The company names don't mean much anymore anyway, just a name on very
similar products from the same plant. (usually China, and work well
until the warranty runs out) ;-))))

Um....

Aren't all of Thomson's RCA/GE branded radios and TV sets made in
China now? I've got a couple of GE branded radios (made in the past 5
years or so) and they're Chinese.

Ditto this one little RCA pocket radio with earphones (a red one with
"Nipper" and "Chipper" printed on the front panel). Made in China too.

We do?

Have you ever heard of Cor-Craft office products? These are generally
pieces of office furniture. Manufactured by prisoners, usually sold and
used by government agencies.

Licence plates are stamped by prisoners in a lot of states.

These people get paid pittances for their work.
