 Suzanne 
Hi, I'm Suzanne from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1210052" id="Pl-1" latLong="39.952°N 75.164°W" state="PA" type="PPL">Philadelphia</PLACE>.


 Sara 
Hi, this is Sara, from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778" id="Pl-2" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="CA" type="CIVIL">California</PLACE>.


 Suzanne 
Hi.


 Sara 
Hey.


 Suzanne 
So who do you think should run?


 Sara 
uh -- I don't know. I was going to say, that's quite the topic.  um -- I
haven't thought about it much.  I know my husband said he thinks -- that
uh -- Colin Powell should -- but I don't think he will.


 Suzanne 
I I don't he think will either, because he turned it down in two
thousand and four.


 Sara 
Right, and


 Suzanne 
Sorry, two thousand and -- two thousand.


 Sara 
Two thousand, yeah, the one before that.


 Suzanne 
Yeah.


 Sara 
Yeah.  uh -- I'm not very fond of Hillary Clinton, so I -- I don't think
I'd go for her, but -- but uh what do you think?


 Suzanne 
um -- I am reluctant to see another Bush brother on the ticket for the
Republicans


 Sara 
Mhm.


 Suzanne 
but I think that putting Jeb Bush would make h- -- the Republican ticket
easier to defeat.


 Sara 
Mhm.


 Suzanne 
um -- I really don't think that Hillary Clinton -- would be -- a good choice
for the Democrats.


 Sara 
Yeah.


 Suzanne 
um I don't think Barak Obama would be a very good choice for the
Democrats.


 Sara 
Uh-huh.


 Suzanne 
Just because he's -- he's really young, and he's going to be starting
off his career.


 Sara 
Uh-huh.


 Suzanne 
um I would almost like to see John Edwards on the ticket again.


 Sara 
Uh-huh. Yeah.  uh Yeah. Did they ever do that one? That's n- the-
that's happened before, hasn't it, where someone who -- who was
defeated ran again?


 Suzanne 
Yeah.


 Sara 
They don't do it very often, probably just because they figure if he
lost once, he'll


 Suzanne 
Well I I think he's a really good candidate, and four more years could
really help him develop his um -- could help him develop -- hi- his
voting record especially.


 Sara 
Right.


 Suzanne 
And I think that would help the Democratic ticket a lot.


 Sara 
Right, because that's something he got -- kind of -- uh -- got brought up a
lot.


 Suzanne 
Yeah.


 Sara 
Hm. Well, they -- let's see.


 Suzanne 
I mean, I'd like to s- -- I'd like to see the Greens run David Cobb
again.


 Sara 
Uh-huh.  uh See, hav- I haven't paid much attention to them, I -- I
kind of looked at the -- the other listed candidates -- but I figure -- they
d- -- they d- none of them had enough support to get close, so


 Suzanne 
Yeah.


 Sara 
um -- trying to think who else -- Arnold Schwarzenegger I don't think --
well he's not qualified anyway, but


 Suzanne 
Well, they might change something, you know, between now and then.


 Sara 
I've heard people say that would take a -- I I don't think they will.
uh That takes a Constitutional amendment. That's pretty hard to -- to
get through.


 Suzanne 
Well, I mean, you live in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778" id="Pl-3" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="CA" type="CIVIL">California</PLACE>. How is he doing -- in your state?


 Sara 
Oh, I think he's done all right, um -- I I -- He's a he's a moderate
Republican, you know, he's not


 Suzanne 
Right.


 Sara 
he's not uh -- hard core Republican, so he works pretty well with -- since
this is this is mostly a Democratic State.  He does pretty well.


 Suzanne 
um -- They've been talking about getting the <PLACE country="CA" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19437937" id="Pl-5" latLong="60.000°N 96.000°W" type="COUNTRY">Canadian</PLACE>-born governor of
I think <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:663849" id="Pl-4" latLong="46.250°N 94.250°W" state="MN" type="CIVIL">Minnesota</PLACE>


 Sara 
Mhm.


 Suzanne 
to run as well. um


 Sara 
Hm.


 Suzanne 
It'd be the first woman running.


 Sara 
Right.  Have they never had a woman run before? I know they've


 Suzanne 
Well, Geraldine Ferraro -- well the first woman for a major party.
Geraldine Ferraro ran


 Sara 
Uh-huh.


 Suzanne 
as Vice President -- for the Democrats, I believe


 Sara 
Uh-huh.


 Suzanne 
um -- in the eighties.


 Sara 
Right.


 Suzanne 
But they've never had a woman as a major candidate


 Sara 
Uh-huh.


 Suzanne 
for President.


 Sara 
Right.  Yeah. It's got to happen at some point.


 Suzanne 
Right. Because Elizabeth Dole didn't make it too well.


 Sara 
Right.  Yeah, she was she was going to be the -- was she going to be the
Vice President


 Suzanne 
I think she was g- actually going for President herself.


 Sara 
candidate?  She was actually going for President?


 Suzanne 
I'd like to see her come back. um I think she's fantastic.


 Sara 
Uh-huh.  Yeah, I


 Suzanne 
And she's she's not too hard-core Republican.


 Sara 
Right.  Yeah. I don't know. This -- This uh -- last election being just
over, I hadn't really started thinking much about the next one.


 Suzanne 
Right.  Do you think any of the s- any other state governors have a
really good chance?  uh I'm


 Sara 
You know, I I mean obviously, if Schwarzenegger could run, he's got
the name recognition, but I would be really surprised -- both to see him
run and to see him win, but then again -- I was a little bit surprised
when he won <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778" id="Pl-6" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="CA" type="CIVIL">California</PLACE>, so
