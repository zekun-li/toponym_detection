11. Holiday Traditions: The holiday season is right around the
corner. Who do you like to celebrate with during the holidays? Do you go
to a lot of parties with friends, neighbors, co-workers or family
members? Are there people you see during the holidays that you don't see
during the rest of the year? Do you travel to meet up with family or
friends during the holidays? Where do you go and who do you visit?

And I'm a counselor. I'm a therapist.


 Kate 
Oh, that's wonderful.


 Judy 
I'm just not able to work right now.


 Kate 
Oh, with the fatigue.


 Judy 
Right. It's wha- it's more than fatigue. It's a whole group of things,
and it- and you run a lot of fever.  When you get in the severe stage,
you know, you get out once a week and do what you have to do- because
my husband doesn't drive, because of coordination problems from a head
injury- -- and that puts you out for the rest of the week.


 Kate 
Oh my word. Well, you have a lot to deal with.


 Judy 
Well,  I have a lot of faith in God, so that works.


 Kate 
Yes. Amen.


 Judy 
That works with my holidays, too.
