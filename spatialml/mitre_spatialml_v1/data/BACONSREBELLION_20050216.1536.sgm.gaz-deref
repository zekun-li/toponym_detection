Car Tax Cut Acceleration Hits a Wall

As expected the Senate Finance Committee this afternoon killed a
proposal by House Republicans to finish implementation of the car tax
cut by phasing out the remaining 30% over the next six years. The move
leaves intact state reimbursement for the locally-imposed property tax
at an aggregate of $950 million annually. At present, that amount covers
approximately 70% of the tax for the average affected car owner. The
commitee action comes two days before House and Senate budget conferees
are expected to begin negotiating differences in the respective
proposals.

Yep, like I said before, it's either Chichester's way or the highway.
It's simply mind-boggling that Chichester is allowed to single-handedly
govern our entire state.

I hate to shatter your illusions Barnie. Your chum, Gov. Pinocchio,
is not in-charge of the State. Chichester is new our master...

What if Chichester had been elected Lt. Gov, instead of Wilder, all
those years ago? Fun to speculate. Both are still pretty important,
while so many of their contemporaries have had their moments and moved
on.

Mark Warner's career might not have gotten off the ground - didn't he
chair Wilder's campaign in 89?
