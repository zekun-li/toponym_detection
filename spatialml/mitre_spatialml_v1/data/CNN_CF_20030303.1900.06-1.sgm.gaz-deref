Time for &quot;Fireback,&quot; when the viewers fire back at us. Joshua Hosford of
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1661104 IGDB:1662104" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.619°N 117.928°W" state="CA" type="PPL">Newport Beach</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778 USGS:1779778" id="Pl-3" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="CA" type="CIVIL">California</PLACE> -- that would be nice in this weathers --
&quot;Paul, I guess we're going after all. Case in point, Khalid Shaikh
Mohammed. It's amazing how someone can actually do two things at once.
I'm chewing gum and talking on the phone while writing this note.&quot;
Joshua, you couldn't have said anything better. In fact, I've already
said it.


 BEGALA 
Well, in fact, our allies got Mr. Mohammed along with us. We need allies.
And Bush is so far angered every ally we have. Dan Snyder of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1169566 USGS:1168566" id="Pl-5" latLong="40.635°N 80.228°W" state="PA" type="PPL">Baden</PLACE>,
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780798 USGS:1779798" id="Pl-4" latLong="40.750°N 77.750°W" state="PA" type="CIVIL">Pennsylvania</PLACE> writes, &quot;Bush should torture the al Qaeda chief operations
officer. Bush has been torturing Americans for two years. Why should this
guy get preferential treatment?&quot;

 NOVAK 
And I thought he was -- I thought he was busy running the Redskins. No?
OK. The next comment is from Frank Mastro of <PLACE CTV="CITY" country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772 USGS:975772" id="Pl-6" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL">New York City</PLACE>. &quot;Mr. Novak, I
don't understand the problem. If the budget goes through as is, why don't
Mr. Begala and Mr. Carville just donate the extra tax money they don't
want?&quot; I say that to all the rich millionaire Democrats, like Carville
and Begala, who don't want tax cuts. Pay it anyway.


 BEGALA 
I'll donate to the Democrats. They'll defeat Bush and everybody will get
rich. That's a better strategy. David Horn of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:955858 IGDB:956858" id="Pl-8" latLong="43.152°N 76.061°W" state="NY" type="RGN">Long Island</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779796 IGDB:1780796" id="Pl-7" latLong="43.000°N 75.500°W" state="NY" type="CIVIL">New York</PLACE>,
writes, &quot;How can Bush say he's for democracy? He had to sue to become our
president, and he keeps trying to bribe other countries' democratic
governments into his supporting his agenda. Where did he learn to govern,
