Much of the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-10" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> is unstable, but national

be doing intstead?  Do you think the elections scheduled for January
will take place, and if not, then what?


 A 
I agree. I agree with that. Do- do you know of anybody who's over
there at all right now?


 B 
Um, not right now, no. No.


 A 
I have -- my cousin's getting ready to go over there and it just, oh,
it just makes me sick. It just --


 B 
Yeah. Well, I don't blame you. I -- like I said, you know, most of my
family is


 A 
the whole thing.


 B 
military and, uh,  you know, it's funny because my husband was in the
marines and he's all, you know,  well, you know, they're over there
doing a duty. But my dad was in the army and he was in <PLACE country="VN" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3733340 IGDB:16266660" id="Pl-11" latLong="16.167°N 107.833°E" type="COUNTRY">Vietnam</PLACE> war and
he's like, this is crazy, you know. Bush is an idiot, you know.


 A 
Yep.


 B 
And, um,  I mean, I agree with my dad and, you know, if anybody should
know it's someone that fought in a war, you know.


 A 
Exactly. Exactly, they would definitely know.  Well, you he- you hear
these people saying that, I mean, that are in the mili- military you-
you -- that it sa- you- some people who have come back home already
and everything that they don't agree with the whole thing. I mean,
it's -- that's- that's pretty --


 B 
And he- -- That's bad when, you know-


 A 
that's bad when they were there and were- and were living and they
don't agree with it, you know.


 B 
Exactly. Exactly. Well, my dad said basically it's for the money. It
was for the money.


 A 
Eh.


 B 
And and and to me, to let people die because so your friends


 A 
Yeah.


 B 
you know your politician friends and whoever other friends can make
more money.  They're already rich. How much more money do they need?


 A 
Exact- they're -- greedy. Greedy greedy greedy.


 B 
You know- -- Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, and and here are these military guys
giving their lives, and working hard every day through training and
stuff even if there isn't a war,


 A 
Exactly.


 B 
and you're paying them piss -- because I don't know if you watch the
news a lot, but,  uh, like, last summer they showed military people
standing on lines for, like, getting food and stuff that they don't
get paid enough -- to where-


 A 
Yeah, they said that there were some -- yeah, I s- I saw a story about
that where they- where they're-


 B 
Yeah, it was, like, on twenty twenty or something.


 A 
yeah, they're- where they're coming home from the war and they --
yeah, they're- they're pretty much homeless and- and ha- they have
nothing.


 B 
Yeah.  Yeah, so what the hell is going on? You know, you're sending
these guys over there and you want them to be at peace of mind, you
know, they- you want them to be able to fight, you know,


 A 
That's- -- Eh, yeah.


 B 
and to be able to save their lives and they're worried about their
families. You know, that's just --


 A 
Yeah, and they c- the come home to nothing after g- all they've gone
through they come home and they have nothing.


 B 
you can't do that.  Yeah.


 A 
That's just -- eh, that's just pathetic.


 B 
That's what -- you know, that's what people need to, you know, speak
up about and nobody- nobody ever does. And- and it's like a, you know,
I don't know if you remember, but it was like


 A 
Nobody does.  I know.


 B 
right -- a little bit right after the war started in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> there was a
soldier that spoke out and he got reprimanded for it.


 A 
Yes, I do remember that. Yes, he got, um,  he- well, one, uh --
somebody, like, left didn't they? They just -- he was, like, one of
the major-


 B 
Yeah, but this was another guy. He just -- he repri- you know, he- he
just,


 A 
it was -- another guy.


 B 
uh, spoke out against the war publicly and he got reprimanded for it


 A 


 B 
and it's supposed to be a big no-no. But, you know what,  they have
every right, you know. What happened to <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-12" type="COUNTRY">America</PLACE>?


 A 
Yeah, it's freedom of speech. I mean, we used to have to right to say
what you-


 B 
Yeah, we're over there supposedly helping <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, and I don't think
those people care either --


 A 
No, I don't think they-


 B 
I mean, uh, some of them do -- but then most of the idiots are the ones
that are causing these problems. If it was -- -- if it -- if they
thought that it was such a great thing,  then why aren't the people
helping us? You know,


 A 
Exactly.


 B 
me as a person, if some- if someone came over and was helping me, me
as a person whether I was in the military or not, I would be helping
and I'd be going around saying, look idiots, stop bomb- you know, I
jus-


 A 
Right.


 B 
uh, instead of -- it- it seems like every time they do a news report
there is even the average m- Joe Schmo over there is complaining, you
know.


 A 
E- exactly, and it- it just makes you wonder h- eh, what really is, I
mean, what is it really like in there? Why aren't they -- why aren't
they coming to er-


 B 
Yeah, and if they're not going to be grateful, then what the hell.


 A 
What the hell are we doing over there? Yeah, wh- they- why aren't they
appreciating us a little more.


 B 
Yeah yeah yeah. Exactly, because they really don't. I mean, they look
at us as -- the parties that are causing problems, look at us as we're
very corrupt. You have to remember, religion-wise,


 A 
Yep.


 B 
how they are. What- they way we live is just -- totally against they're
religion.


 A 
And that's, eh, they- the way they live is just so weird anyways, you
know, it's just-


 B 
Yeah.  Yeah, but they think of us as weird. ((Hold on Jen.)) You know,
so, you just, uh,


 A 
Exactly. I, uh-


 B 
everybody's got their own way of, you know, thinking and- and they
don't want -- the biggest problem is- is -- we're pushing ourselves on
them, you know.  They're not pushing their religion on us.


 A 
Exactly. Exactly.


 B 
You know, and so -- I- I guess -- I would have a problem if someone was
shoving something down my throat, you know,  saying, this is how it
should be.  And- and that's -- and that's how we're- we are. We're
going over there, we're saying,  look, this is how we do it -- and, um,
i- -- so we think everybody else should be that way.


 A 
D- do you know much about the -- what- what is the elections going on
in January? Do you know what going- I-


 B 
I- I really hadn't paid attention. I know that it's supposed to go on.
I know that,


 A 
I- -- -ther.


 B 
um,  one of the other countries, I can't think of the name, tried
doing it and then it was a big -- they had a big -- problem because they
said it was a,  um, that it- -- the guy shouldn't have won. I forget
which country that was. Oh, <PLACE country="AF" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16632074 NGA:-3367926" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.000°N 65.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Afghanistan</PLACE> did a
