Here's an incredible story about an unsung hero until now. From BBC
News : A retired <PLACE country="IT" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19880600" id="Pl-1" latLong="42.833°N 12.833°E" type="COUNTRY">Italian</PLACE> doctor has revealed for the first time how he
invented a fictitious disease which fooled the Nazis during World War
II. The trick of prescribing Jews with a mysterious illness terrified
the Nazis and saved 45 Roman Jews.

Dr Vittorio Sacerdoti has told his remarkable tale on the 60th
anniversary of liberation of <PLACE country="IT" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19873307" id="Pl-2" latLong="41.900°N 12.483°E" state="RM" type="PPLC">Rome</PLACE>. Just 28 years old at the time, he
used courage and ingenuity to save 45 people from certain death.

As other Jews were being rounded up, Dr Sacerdoti admitted anyone who
could reach the hospital as patients - and diagnosed them with a
dangerous disease.

"We would write on their medical forms that the patient was suffering
from K Syndrome," he said. "We called it K after the <PLACE country="DE" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18224345" id="Pl-3" latLong="51.500°N 10.500°E" type="COUNTRY">German</PLACE> commander
Kesserling - the Nazis thought it was cancer or tuberculosis, and they
fled like rabbits."

K Syndrome saved his cousin, Luciana Sacerdoti, who was just 10 years
old.

"The day the Nazis came to the hospital, someone came to our room and
said: 'You have to cough, you have to cough a lot because they are
afraid of the coughing, they don't want to catch an awful disease and
they won't enter'."
