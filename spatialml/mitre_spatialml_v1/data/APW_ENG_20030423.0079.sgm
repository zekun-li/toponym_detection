The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority said it began a trial of
the scanners Wednesday at its <PLACE country="SG" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:20026475" id="Pl-12" latLong="1.444°N 103.777°E" type="PPL">Woodlands</PLACE> and <PLACE country="SG" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19926275" id="Pl-13" latLong="1.321°N 103.657°E" type="PPL">Tuas</PLACE> checkpoints to
screen for people suffering from severe acute respiratory syndrome.

Nine scanners, developed locally for military purposes, were placed
at <PLACE country="SG" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19926364" id="Pl-4" latLong="1.367°N 103.800°E" type="COUNTRY">Singapore</PLACE>'s <PLACE country="SG" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:20052940" id="Pl-14" latLong="1.393°N 103.990°E" type="PPL">Changi</PLACE> Airport last week to check people arriving from
SARS-affected countries.

Those who show up on the camera screen as ``hot bodies,'' or with a
temperature greater than 37.5 degrees Celsius (99.5 degrees
Fahrenheit), will be pulled aside.

Each day about 90,000 people cross the border between <PLACE country="MY" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17594843" id="Pl-10" latLong="2.500°N 112.500°E" type="COUNTRY">Malaysia</PLACE> and

temperature would be directed to a nearby nurse station for further
checks.

of 186 infected from the flu-like illness. Globally, at least 236

checkpoints, where passengers are already required to disembark for
immigration purposes.
