<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-38" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> commandos captured a half brother of Saddam Hussein on
Thursday, the latest success in a campaign to round up insiders from
the former regime. <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> troops thwarted a <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-28" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> bank robbery over
the protests of Iraqis eager to share in the loot.

As <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> forces struggled to restore order in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-14" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>, FBI Director
Robert Mueller announced that agents had been detailed to help
recover antiquities looted from museums in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-29" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> and elsewhere.
Agents will aid international efforts to recover stolen items ``on
both the open and black markets,'' he said.

With the fighting all but over, the USS Constellation steamed from
the <PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18493586" id="Pl-42" latLong="27.000°N 51.000°E" type="BODYOFWATER">Persian Gulf</PLACE> for its home port, carrying dozens of warplanes no
longer needed. It was the second aircraft carrier ordered home in
recent days.

The <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> military's search for chemical and biological weapons is
unlikely to succeed until Iraqis lead <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-39" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> forces to them,
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said Thursday.

``I don't think we'll discover anything, myself,'' Rumsfeld said at a
meeting with Pentagon employees. ``I think what will happen is we'll
discover people who will tell us where to go find it.''

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> troops have found suspicious chemicals and facilities at a
number of sites but tests on the materials have proved negative or
inconclusive. Eliminating such weapons was a chief reason President
George W. Bush gave for the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE>-led invasion of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-15" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> that began
March 20.

Brig. Gen. Vincent Brooks announced the capture of Barzan Ibrahim
Hasan al-Tikriti, telling reporters he was an adviser to Saddam
``with extensive knowledge of the regime's inner workings.''

A <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-7" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Barzan Ibrahim had been a presidential adviser to Saddam's
regime since 1998, but had a shaky relationship with his half brother
and was not part of the regime's inner circle.

He was a representative to the United Nations in <PLACE country="CH" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17447849" id="Pl-43" latLong="46.200°N 6.167°E" state="GE" type="PPLC">Geneva</PLACE> from 1989 to
1998. Earlier, from 1979 to 1983, he headed <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-16" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>'s Mukhabarat, or
intelligence service, a period when the organization arranged
executions of regime opponents in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-17" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> and overseas, the official
said.

Brooks provided scant details of the operation that netted Barzan
Ibrahim, saying he was taken inside <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-30" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> and that <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> special
forces were aided by Marines. He said there were no casualties.

Another of Saddam's three half brothers, Watban Ibrahim Hasan
al-Tikriti, was captured earlier by <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> forces. The third has not
been found.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-40" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> forces have been criticized for failing to stop looting in
several <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-31" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> cities, and there have been complaints, as well, that
humanitarian relief has been slow in arriving.

But Marines foiled a brazen act of lawlessness during the day when
they interrupted a robbery-in-progress at a branch of the al-Rashid
Bank and took away <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-44" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>$4 million for safekeeping.

Thieves had blown a hole in the vault and dropped children in to
bring out fistfuls of cash. As word spread that the robbery was under
way, Iraqis gathered, saying they had accounts at the branch, and a
riot broke out.

Marines broke it up  _	over the protests of Iraqis not involved in
the robbery  _	and the thieves were arrested.

``These people want the money and they believe it is rightfully their
money, but they don't understand that the proper distribution is not
first-come, first-served,'' said Col. Philip DeCamp, a battalion
commander.

Gen. Tommy Franks, the commander of Operation <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-18" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> Freedom, told
reporters during a visit to <PLACE country="KW" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19210228" id="Pl-45" latLong="29.500°N 47.750°E" type="COUNTRY">Kuwait</PLACE> that ``the looting goes down every
day and I think you will continue to see it go down because the
Iraqis are now stepping up and controlling the problems for
themselves.''

There was evidence of slow progress. <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-32" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> residents gathered
outside the <PLACE CTV="CITY" country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-34" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE>'s police academy when word spread that some of the
cars looted in recent days had been recovered.

Still, more than a week after the regime collapsed, Marine Staff Sgt.
Jose Guillen said power has been restored  _  by use of diesel plants
 _  to only about 500 homes in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-33" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>, a <PLACE CTV="CITY" country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-35" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE> of roughly 5 million.
He said <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-10" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> forces expect to get one of the <PLACE CTV="CITY" country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-36" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">city</PLACE>'s power grids on
line by Friday.

Unrest continued in other parts of the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-22" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>. Americans sought to
bring calm to <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897344" id="Pl-46" latLong="36.335°N 43.119°E" state="NI" type="PPLA">Mosul</PLACE>, where <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-11" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> troops killed 17 people in clashes
earlier in the week.

Brooks, briefing reporters at the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-12" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> Central Command headquarters,
also disclosed that Marines had broken up violent clashes on
Wednesday in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16888105" id="Pl-47" latLong="34.597°N 43.677°E" state="SD" type="PPL">Tikrit</PLACE>, Saddam's hometown. The fighting broke out
between club-wielding members of the former ruler's clan and a rival
group, he said.

Clan rivalries aside, there are numerous other resentments shaping
events in the post-Saddam era. Majority Shiite Muslims are eager for
power after decades of Saddam favoring Sunni Muslims, for example.
And Kurds are eager to claim what they say Saddam took from them and
gave to Arabs in the northern part of the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-23" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="N" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>.

International experts, appalled at the looting of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-19" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> historical
artifacts, met in <PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18543072" id="Pl-48" latLong="48.867°N 2.333°E" state="75" type="PPLC">Paris</PLACE> under U.N. auspices and called for a
temporary embargo on <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-20" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> cultural objects.

Some of the participants at the meeting said it appeared the looting
was organized, and some of those involved had keys to museum vaults
and were able to remove items from safes.

One suggested the effort was organized from outside <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-21" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>.

``It looks as if part of the looting was a deliberate planned
action,'' said McGuire Gibson, a University of <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:424587" id="Pl-49" latLong="41.850°N 87.650°W" state="IL" type="PPL">Chicago</PLACE> professor and
president of the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-41" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> Association for Research in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-25" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>.

``I have a suspicion it was organized outside the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-24" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>, in fact
I'm pretty sure it was,'' Gibson said. He added that if a good police
team was put together, ``I think it could be cracked in no time.''

The <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-26" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> museum housed irreplaceable <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:30014910" id="Pl-50" type="RGN">Babylonian</PLACE>, <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16888490" id="Pl-51" latLong="32.156°N 44.984°E" type="RGN">Sumerian</PLACE> and
