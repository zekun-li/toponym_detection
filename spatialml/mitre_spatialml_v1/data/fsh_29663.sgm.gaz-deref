12. Crime: Have you or someone you know ever been the victim of a
crime?  If so, describe what happened.  What kinds of crimes do you
worry about in your hometown?  Are there any places you avoid because
of the high crime rate?  What do you think authorities should do to
make your hometown a safer place?


 Jenny 
I'm Jenny. I'm in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779784 IGDB:1780784" id="Pl-1" latLong="40.000°N 89.250°W" state="IL" type="CIVIL">Illinois</PLACE>.


 Bill 
Hi. My name is Bill, I'm from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778 USGS:1779778" id="Pl-4" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="CA" type="CIVIL">California</PLACE>.


 Jenny 
Um, n- uh, this is kind of a hard question for me. I live in a little
teeny, tiny <PLACE CTV="TOWN" country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-6" state="IL" type="PPL">town</PLACE> in the middle of nowhere. We don't really have
much for crime.


 Bill 
Wow. I live in a huge <PLACE CTV="TOWN" country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-7" state="CA" type="PPL">town</PLACE> and it's, like, I live in a big <PLACE CTV="CITY" country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-8" state="CA" type="PPL">city</PLACE>
and there's lots of crime. So that's the complete opposite view.
I mean, I- eh-


 Jenny 
Um, I mean, well we- well we have crime, I mean, I make it sound
like <PLACE comment="imaginary" country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-9" type="PPL">Mayberry</PLACE> but it- it's not exactly all that great. I mean, we
have little things. We have c- we have car theft and...


 Bill 
W- you were saying y-


 Jenny 
And stuff but...


 Bill 
No homicide, right.


 Jenny 
I mean- No, well, none that I'm aware of. Um, no, I mean,
there's only fifteen hundred people in my home town and we're twenty
miles from, like, the nearest hospital, we're twenty miles from the
nearest grocery store.


 Bill 
Wow.


 Jenny 
It's it's a little teeny, tiny <PLACE CTV="TOWN" country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-10" state="IL" type="PPL">town</PLACE>.


 Bill 
Wow. That's crazy.


 Jenny 
And, I mean, yeah, we we have, like, drug busts at the school
and stuff, but it's not like -- they have, like, marijuana, that's
about it. And, um.


 Bill 
I...


 Jenny 
Ah, I don't know just i- it doesn't seem like really big
stuff to me.


 Bill 
Uh-huh.


 Jenny 
Um, my husband's parents were -- lived in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778 USGS:1779778" id="Pl-5" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="CA" type="CIVIL">California</PLACE> for quite some
time and I know it can be pretty bad out there. They lived in
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:254387 USGS:253387" id="Pl-11" latLong="38.519°N 121.519°W" state="CA" type="PPL">Riverside</PLACE>.


 Bill 
Uh-huh.


 Jenny 
Um.


 Bill 
That's very -- Well I mean, there's lots of -- now it's bad.


 Jenny 
I know.


 Bill 
Uh-huh.


 Jenny 
And this has probably been, oh, probably eighteen years ago that his
parents were out there. They're both passed away now but, um, I know
back then, eh, my husband's dad said there were neighborhoods he
wouldn't drive through because there were shootings and gang fights
and stuff going on all the time.


 Bill 
There's lots of gangs out there. I wouldn't -- you know, I wouldn't -- 
I I wouldn't go -- I wouldn't hang out there for very long.


 Jenny 
And see, like, where I'm at, um, well, I'm close to the s- I'm like
fifty miles from the <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="USGS:1779784 IGDB:1780784" id="Pl-12" latLong="40.000°N 89.250°W" state="IL" type="CIVIL">State</PLACE> <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="USGS:426595 IGDB:427595" id="Pl-13" latLong="39.802°N 89.644°W" state="IL" type="PPLA">Capital</PLACE>.


 Bill 
Uh-huh.


 Jenny 
But, um, where I'm at next l- biggest <PLACE CTV="TOWN" country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-16" state="IL" type="PPL">town</PLACE> from me they say that
there're gangs and stuff in that <PLACE CTV="TOWN" country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-17" state="IL" type="PPL">town</PLACE> but...


 Bill 
Really?


 Jenny 
I mean, I don't really see it. It- it's not real evident like
what you would see on TV.


 Bill 
Uh-huh. There's gangs all over here. Certain areas you just
don't want to -- you just don't want to go through.


 Jenny 
I don't really have any good responses to their questions because
they're -- there aren't any areas that I really avoid or anything like
that. I mean, like I say, I live close to <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:426595 IGDB:427595" id="Pl-15" latLong="39.802°N 89.644°W" state="IL" type="PPLA">Springfield</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779784 IGDB:1780784" id="Pl-2" latLong="40.000°N 89.250°W" state="IL" type="CIVIL">Illinois</PLACE>,
fairly close, and when I go there, if I want to go somewhere, I
just go. I don't worry about what the neighborhood looks like or
anything. I just go and I think I probably should be a little more
concerned but I'm not.


 Bill 
Well, I, you know, gro- living here, I just -- I'm always
on the -- I'm always on guard it seems like. You know, you don't
know -- you're -- certain neighborhoods you just can't- -- you g- you
got to watch your back, you know.


 Jenny 
I would just feel so uncomfortable like that.


 Bill 
Uh-huh.


 Jenny 
That's like...


 Bill 
Yeah, I'd, I...


 Jenny 
Th- the town that I live in, I mean, my youngest child is nine,
and if she wants to ride her bike across <PLACE CTV="TOWN" country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-18" state="IL" type="PPL">town</PLACE>, go. Just go. 


 Bill 
Wow.


 Jenny 
And I do know that in, like, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:411012 IGDB:412012" id="Pl-20" latLong="39.734°N 90.229°W" state="IL" type="PPL">Jacksonville</PLACE>, uh, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779784 IGDB:1780784" id="Pl-3" latLong="40.000°N 89.250°W" state="IL" type="CIVIL">Illinois</PLACE>, which is
close to me, that's the next biggest <PLACE CTV="TOWN" country="US" form="NOM" gazref="USGS:411012 IGDB:412012" id="Pl-19" latLong="39.734°N 90.229°W" state="IL" type="PPL">town</PLACE>, uh, I wouldn't let my kid
ride three or four blocks from home.


 Bill 
Uh-huh.


 Jenny 
Just because, eh, you go that far and you don't know your
neighbors, you don't you don't know anybody. It's not really
because of the crime, it's just more because you don't know
anybody.


 Bill 
Right.


 Jenny 
And, so, I mean, I'm I'm really have a good comfort zone where I'm at
because I know, like, almost everybody in <PLACE CTV="TOWN" country="US" form="NOM" id="Pl-21" state="IL" type="PPL">town</PLACE>. So, I don't know, I
guess we get kind of a false sense of security in these little towns.


 Bill 
Yeah, until something happens, you know.


 Jenny 
Yeah.


 Bill 
It it only takes one person to kind of shock everybody.


 Jenny 
Oh, definitely. We have had, in the past, we've had some major crimes.
We did have, um, a couple murders go on in town. It was guys fighting
over women and one guy shot the other guy and...


 Bill 
Uh-huh.


 Jenny 
I mean, that's probably been thirty years ago.


 Bill 
Oh.


 Jenny 
And, probably the worst thing that we have now is people running their
little meth labs or picking marijuana out of the corn field. So, it it
seems like really small potatoes to me. I -- it doesn't seem like
really big issues.


 Bill 
Well, meth labs are e- that's kind of a -- -- that can be dangerous.


 Jenny 
Oh yeah. Definitely.


 Bill 
Especially if they -- you know, m- most of those drug dealers have
guns and it's like that can be a problem.


 Jenny 
And I think they're popping up more in the rural areas here because we
have the accessibility to all the fertilizers and things that they use
in that stuff.


 Bill 
Yeah.
