With no web presence, publications like the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1500957" id="Pl-3" latLong="37.554°N 77.461°W" state="VA" type="PPLA">Richmond</PLACE> Free Press are
rarely acknowledged in the blogosphere. The RFP serves the
African-American community in the <PLACE CTV="CITY" country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1500957" id="Pl-1" latLong="37.554°N 77.461°W" state="VA" type="PPLA">City of Richmond</PLACE>.

In the latest edition, staff writer Jeremy M. Lazarus reports that
the Legislative Black Caucus celebrated killing a bill that would have
merged the Department of Minority Business Enterprise (DMBE) with the
Department of Business Assistance (DBA). Del. Dwight Jones (D-<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1500957" id="Pl-4" latLong="37.554°N 77.461°W" state="VA" type="PPLA">Richmond</PLACE>),
chair of the caucus, said killing the bill had been their "main
objective" in an effort to, according to Lazarus, "promote economic
justice for black businesses."

I believe any neutral management consultant worth his or her salt
would recommend a merger of the two organizations. There is considerable
duplication of effort and DBA is strong in one area--financial
controls--where DMBE has consistently had problems. There would be
service benefits to business clients, too. Nonetheless, the symbolism of
having their "own" agency and support from Governor Warner for
maintaining DMBE's "independence" apparently overcame any efficiency and
service argument.

Another article, this one by staff writer Skeeter Faulk, describes
Sen. George Allen's commitment to naming the new Federal courthouse in
downtown <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1500957" id="Pl-5" latLong="37.554°N 77.461°W" state="VA" type="PPLA">Richmond</PLACE> for Spottswood W. Robinson III, a noted NAACP lawyer
and federal judge. Robinson worked with Thurgood Marshall on Brown v.
Board of Education . Faulk finds the nomination a "surprise" in light of
Allen's past, when he "embraced and glorified the Confederate flag and
its sympathizers." Faulk chalks the naming up to Allen's presidential
ambitions.

It's tough to be a Republican when it comes to the African-American
community. Do nothing and you confirm their worst suspicions; do
something and it arouses a different kind of suspicion.

Will, I share your frustration at the reaction to Allen's nod to
Spottswood Robins. Among some segments of the African-American
community, it is indeed a matter of damned-if-you-do,
damned-if-you-don't. But you could say the same thing of the Democratic
Party as a whole.

I think it's important to recognize that African Americans, though
still overwhelmingly Democratic, comprise less of a monolith than they
did 20-30 years ago. I find myself continually amazed at how open-minded
many young African-Americans are. And I think that open-mindedness goes
a long way to explain the desperate efforts of many (not all, but many)
within the Democratic Party to circle the wagons with the cry of
"racism, racism, racism" when the evidence of racism is increasingly a
stretch. It's like how, after the Civil War, Republicans "waved the
bloody shirt", associating the Democratic Party with the secession and,
ultimately, the war itself. Eventually, that tactic lost its power. And
so, too, will the cries of racism, racism.

Agreed.

More importantly, the lack of disclosure is frightening. Media
General/Times Dispatch, Richmond.com, and the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1500957" id="Pl-6" latLong="37.554°N 77.461°W" state="VA" type="PPLA">Richmond</PLACE> Free Press all
have significant ties to the VPAF's proposed <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780803" id="Pl-2" latLong="37.500°N 78.500°W" state="VA" type="CIVIL">Virginia</PLACE> Performing Arts
Center, yet we do not see anything resembling balanced coverage of the
controversy and debate surrounding this issue.
