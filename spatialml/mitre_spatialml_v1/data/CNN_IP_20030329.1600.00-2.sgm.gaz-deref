 TUCHMAN (voice-over) 
As they get ready to head over hostile territory, 10 men aboard this Air
Force HC-130 search and rescue and refueling plane start to feel their
adrenaline rushing. Who looks out for the unlikely prospect of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE>
aircraft, and the more likely prospect of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> missiles or artillery.
(on camera): Does your mindset change across the border into <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-7" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>?


 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
No, because I am in an area which I don't know where the enemy could be
and I might get to the airplane, by the time I get out of the airplane
I'm thinking the same way.


 TUCHMAN 
Which is?


 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
The hair on the back of my neck starts standing up, then something's
going wrong.


 TUCHMAN (voice-over) 
As a precaution, the crew starts turning the huge plane in circles to see
what the targets do. Ultimately it's discovered the targets are <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE>
combat helicopters. Minutes later the search and rescue helicopter
arrives for its refueling. Watch the flash from our night vision camera
as the plane's fuel line connects with the chopper. Both aircraft fly at
125 miles per hour gingerly over enemy land. At times they are only 50
feet apart with the chopper's rotor blades getting closer. Looking with
the naked eye out of the plane, the helicopter is impossible to see. The
pitch-black maneuver ends after 10 minutes. (on camera): What stops
though - we know the Iraqis have fired sand missiles and fired AAA at
aircraft all throughout this war. They haven't hit anybody, but isn't it
risky flying so low knowing they have that ammunition to fire at you.


 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
Again, we know where we're going. We know where they're at so we simply
avoid them and if for some reason they do get off a lucky shot or they do
see us, we have defensive systems on board the airplane to defeat their
ammunition.


 TUCHMAN 
We all fly with bulletproof vests in case the plane goes down. We also
fly with parachutes in case we need to get out before the plane goes
down. (voice-over): But three airmen aboard this plane have parachutes
for a different reason. They are the Pararescue jumpers, or PJs who jump
off the plane for rescue missions.


 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
I mean it's probably the most - the best feeling in the world knowing
that your purpose is really defined at that moment.


 TUCHMAN 
No rescues were necessary on this sortie. The plane arrived back to base
safely. (on camera): Do you have any fear?


 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
Everybody has a little bit of fear but I think it's a good thing in this
circumstance.


 TUCHMAN (voice-over) 
This crew could be back on another mission in as few as 24 hours.

 TUCHMAN 
This is a very busy base. We want to give you a look right now at the
aircraft coming in for landings. It looks like LAX on a Sunday night and
this is what it's been like for the past 11 days. We have just watched
multitudes of warplanes land, multitudes of warplanes take off and this
may be the busiest night of the campaign. They're expecting a total at
this particular base near the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-8" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="BR" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> border of 300 sorties in a 24-hour
period ending today according to the Air Force total from all the bases
and there are more than 30 bases in 12 different countries in the <PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208667208" id="Pl-16" type="RGN">Middle
East</PLACE> according to the Pentagon. They're saying there will be 1500 sorties
in a 24-hour period ending tomorrow. Eight hundred of those sorties will
be strike sorties using bombs and missiles so there is no slow down in
the amount of air power being used over <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-9" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>. Wolf, back to you.


 BLITZER 
That's a lot of bombs and missiles. Gary Tuchman in an air base near the
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-10" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="BR" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> border, thanks very much, Gary Tuchman. This programming note,
tomorrow at noon Eastern I'll have a special interview with the <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-17" type="COUNTRY">nation</PLACE>'s
top military officer, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. General
Richard Myers will be my special guest on a special late addition. That's
at noon Eastern, nine A.M. Pacific tomorrow. That's Sunday and I'll be
back Judy and at the top of the hour for Wolf Blitzer Reports. We'll have
a complete wrap of all the day's late breaking developments. In the
meantime, back to Judy Woodruff in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:531871 IGDB:532871" id="Pl-2" latLong="38.895°N 77.037°W" state="DC" type="PPLC">Washington</PLACE>.


 WOODRUFF 
We'll be watching you both times at the top of the hour and certainly for
late edition on Sunday. Thanks Wolf. Well, as coalition forces push
north, they are encountering a unique problem of combat, getting rid of
the weapons captured from the enemy. Some of the 40,000 <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-2610495 IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-19" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> troops
are kicking up a lot of dust in the <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-11" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> desert making sure that nothing
is left behind them that could hurt them. Greg Milam is with the <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-2610495 IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-20" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">U.K</PLACE>.
forces in southern <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-12" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="S" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

 GREG MILAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT 
Seemingly deserted, these battered buildings hold a deadly threat to
<PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-2610495 IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-21" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> forces in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-13" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE>.


 SERGEANT GEOFF BANHAM, ROYAL ENGINEERS 
This is what we're coming across a lot of these, 30 mil, 60 mil, 80 mil,
even 120 mil. So there's plenty still out there that will have to be
recovered because they can be used.


 MILAM 
Do you know when this place was last used? I mean do you know
(UNINTELLIGIBLE)


 BANHAM 
I'm not too sure but judging by some of this, it's been here quite a long
time so whether it's been used recently by them - there was an Intel
upbeat saying that they were possibly coming back to try and get this to
use against them.


 MILAM 
Grenades, mortars, all sorts of ammunition abandoned by <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-14" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> soldiers
but there for the taking. The job of these Royal Engineers is to clear
this and many other mountains of armaments and destroy them. Some are too
unstable to be moved and have to be blown up on the spot. The rest is
carried way out into the desert. And today's parts in this conflict, this
kind of work becomes more and more important. With the coalition forces
moving forward the last thing they want is weaponry like this lurking
behind them.


 CAPTAIN ANDY GOOCH, ROYAL ENGINEERS 
With the amounts of ammunition and weapons left about, if they'd used
those systems, that amount of weapon it would have given us a
considerable amount of trouble trying to take the positions.


 MILAM 
With much of this weaponry there is only one safe thing to do. No one in
the <PLACE country="GB" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-2610495 IGDB:17389505" id="Pl-22" latLong="54.000°N 4.000°W" type="COUNTRY">British</PLACE> forces here is willing to take any risks. Greg Milam, Sky
News, <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-15" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" mod="S" type="COUNTRY">Southern Iraq</PLACE>.
