all right. just about 25 minutes long in that press conference there
at nato headquarters in <PLACE country="BE" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18044462" id="Pl-6" latLong="50.833°N 4.333°E" state="BRU" type="PPLC">brussels</PLACE>. he mentioned a headline a short time

powell saying an end will come soon and toward the end, this regime

confirm their whereabouts, but obviously a lot of concern from this
woman as to where whereabouts of her husband and his health. walt
rogers is back with us. we've been in and out now for almost two
hours. what's happening with you and the 7th cav as we continue to
watch your image by way of video phone and the giant m1-a1 tank. walt,
