Beleaguered <PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-1427981 IGDB:18572019" id="Pl-8" latLong="46.000°N 2.000°E" type="COUNTRY">French</PLACE> media group Vivendi Universal is in advanced
negotiations to sell its theme park business to a <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> firm for around
1.5 billion dollars, the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1663328 USGS:1662328" id="Pl-11" latLong="34.052°N 118.243°W" state="CA" type="PPL">Los Angeles</PLACE> Times said Friday.

The report came as the indebted group said it was planning to sell

focus on its telecoms activities and its <PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-1427981 IGDB:18572019" id="Pl-9" latLong="46.000°N 2.000°E" type="COUNTRY">French</PLACE> cable television
business.

The Times said Vivendi Universal was negotiating to sell its flagship
theme parks to <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:976772 USGS:975772" id="Pl-12" latLong="40.714°N 74.006°W" state="NY" type="PPL">New York</PLACE> investment firm Blackstone Group as a the
first step toward dismantling its entertainment empire.

Vivendi Universal officials in the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE> were not immediately
available for comment on Friday.

Under the reported plans, Blackstone Group would buy Vivendi's theme
park division, including Universal Studios <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1660757 IGDB:1661757" id="Pl-13" latLong="34.098°N 118.326°W" state="CA" type="PPL">Hollywood</PLACE>, Universal

Blackstone already holds a 50 percent stake in the two parks that
make up Universal <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:289240 USGS:288240" id="Pl-15" latLong="28.538°N 81.379°W" state="FL" type="PPL">Orlando</PLACE>.

Vivendi earlier this week confirmed months of press speculation that
it planned to shed its entertainment assets by the end of the year,
including its famed Universal movie studio and television assets.

Chief executive Jean-Rene Fourtou told shareholders at the group's
annual general meeting Tuesday that the sale of Vivendi Universal
Entertainment was a major goal for 2003, and that negotiations were
already under way.

However, Fourtou said he had not yet received any firm offer for its
giant <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> music business, Universal Music Group, and had taken no
final decision over its future.

The group, once a <PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-1427981 IGDB:18572019" id="Pl-6" latLong="46.000°N 2.000°E" type="COUNTRY">French</PLACE> utilities company, needs to reshape itself
in order to slash its huge debt burden of around 18 billion dollars.

In 2002, the group recorded a net loss of 23.3 billion euros -- the
biggest ever in <PLACE country="FR" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-1427981 IGDB:18572019" id="Pl-7" latLong="46.000°N 2.000°E" type="COUNTRY">France</PLACE> -- on sales of 28.7 billion.
