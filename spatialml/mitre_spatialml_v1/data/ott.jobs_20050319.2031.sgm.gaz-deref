 Can I get Security Clearence? Or I am done forever. 

Hi:

I am in a dilemma. I am a experienced Oracle DBA/Unix Sys Adm and a Com Sci
grad. from Carleton and have been out of work for about 6 months now.

I have a chance of getting a position but it requires enhanced security
clearence.

Now, back in my high school days I was charged and convicted for assault
(after I had just turned 18) for punching some bully. And at that time I
did'tn know what &quot;conditional sentence&quot; was as my lawyer provided by the
court to me told me that if I pleaed guilty that's what I would get and &quot;all
this will end&quot;. Additonally, he told me that I would'nt have a record (as
this charge would disappear after 3 years).

This happened in 1998, and recently when I was asked to get a police report
check for one of jobs I had applied for, I was told that I had a record. So
basically, now after 7 years I have located thsi bad news and possibly would
ruin my chances of getting any decent job.

My question is (who may shed some light on this), can you pass Enhance
Reliability Clearence in my position? From my research it shows that I would
have to apply for pardon with govt. Or I can get my case reopened and see
what my options are (as I was never guilty but I did what I did in self
defense).

Can anyone advise me on this? (of course I plan to speak to a legal
professional as well but looking for someone who may know if its possible to
get security clearance in my situation).

Appreciate your time.

Thank you.

 Re: Can I get Security Clearence? Or I am done forever. 

I'm no lawyer, but I think your only option would be to apply for a pardon.
The courts would not re-open your case as you had pleaded guilty to the
charge, whether it was warranted or not. May be different had you been found
guilty and new evidence appeared to support your claim of innocence.

You're best to seek the advice of a lawyer, not others in this forum. I
think the The Law Society of <PLACE comment="existed until 1841" country="CA" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-1359384 IGDB:18640616" id="Pl-1" latLong="17.333°N 62.700°W" mod="N" type="COUNTRY">Upper Canada</PLACE> provides a free 30 minute
consultation with a barrister, though that may have changed. I can tell you
that a lawyer is not needed to apply for a pardon.

 Re: Can I get Security Clearence? Or I am done forever. 

A non property offense with limited possibility of personal gain
helps. The fact that the sentence was so recent does not. 50/50 at
best but worth a shot. The pardon services don't speed things up
(currently 31 months total time from first form until pardon)

I would say Joe has the best view of this situation.
I am an ACSO (Alternate Corporate Security Officer, big title, means I
push more paper for the same pay!) and I am the go-to person for
Federal Clearances. I'll likely be able to get you a clearance but I
will take some time(3-6 months is my guess). you will need a transcript
of your conviction (opp-RCMP) and likely need fingerprints. Reliability
shoud be no problem but Secret is pretty much out of the question (not
impossible just highly improbable) until your pardon.
Feel free to contact me.
