Good plan; cigarettes impose pretty high penalties on states,
inasmuch as the states are caretakers for plenty of people who are ill
thanks to cigarettes. What's notable in this debate, however, is that
according to MSN Moneycentral , tobacco executives are attacking the tax
by noting that &quot;While <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1027616 IGDB:1028616" id="Pl-2" latLong="35.501째N 80.001째W" state="NC" type="CIVIL">North Carolina</PLACE>'s excise tax is only 5 cents, the
total taxes given to <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1027616 IGDB:1028616" id="Pl-3" latLong="35.501째N 80.001째W" state="NC" type="CIVIL">North Carolina</PLACE> by smokers adds up to more than 61
cents per pack.&quot; Okay, okay -- since the tobacco companies pay lots of
money to the states, that's technically accurate. But the point of these
taxes is to align the price of a pack with the cost to society, and
inasmuch as these penalties aren't assessed on a per-pack basis, they
don't -- they're a lump-sum reflection of the taxes these companies
ought to have paid before.

Interestingly, the policy of making cigarette buyers pay to
compensate society for the costs they impose is a politically palatable
synthesis of the unpalatable notion of simply refusing treatment unless
they pay full cost. They're basically buying future medical care
throughout their lives, rather than eventually making the (healthy)
remainder of the populace pay up. In short: Good plan.
