All right, Wolf, and we will be watching. Thanks very much. Well, at the

the Republican Guard as effectively no longer being a credible fighting
force. Let's get the very latest from the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1472192 IGDB:1473192" id="Pl-30" latLong="38.871°N 77.056°W" state="VA" type="FAC">Pentagon</PLACE> for the overall war
picture as they see it. Our Jamie McIntyre our senior military affairs
correspondent is with us now. Hello, again, Jamie.


 JAMIE MCINTYRE, CNN SNR. MILITARY AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT 
Well Judy, the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1472192 IGDB:1473192" id="Pl-31" latLong="38.871°N 77.056°W" state="VA" type="FAC">Pentagon</PLACE> is beginning to see positive signs that it hadn't
seen for awhile. First of all, as we saw just a few moments ago on CNN,
the pictures of some of the actual happy <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-5" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> citizens welcoming <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE>
troops, that taking place in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897127 NGA:-3102873" id="Pl-24" latLong="31.992°N 44.351°E" state="NA" type="PPLA">Najaf</PLACE>. Also the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1472192 IGDB:1473192" id="Pl-32" latLong="38.871°N 77.056°W" state="VA" type="FAC">Pentagon</PLACE> is seeing lighter
than expected resistance indicating at least that they may have really
seriously degraded those Republican Guard divisions before the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE>
troops arrived, both in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16892923 NGA:-3107077" id="Pl-20" latLong="32.250°N 43.117°E" state="KA" type="PPLA">Karbala</PLACE> and also in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897407 NGA:-3102593" id="Pl-22" latLong="32.498°N 45.829°E" state="WA" type="PPLA">Al Kut</PLACE>. They met lighter than
expected resistance. But the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1472192 IGDB:1473192" id="Pl-33" latLong="38.871°N 77.056°W" state="VA" type="FAC">Pentagon</PLACE> officials stress that as they close

so- called red zone where Saddam Hussein is believed to have given his
commanders authority to use chemical weapons, and that use of chemical
weapons remains a real fear at the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1472192 IGDB:1473192" id="Pl-34" latLong="38.871°N 77.056°W" state="VA" type="FAC">Pentagon</PLACE>.

 MAJOR GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL, JOINT CHIEFS, VICE DIR. 
We are not expecting to drive into <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-14" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> suddenly and seize it in a
coup de mains, or anything like that. So, in regard to that, we are
paying great attention to their ability to defend on the ground. They may
just suddenly be effective on the ground. Additionally, their ability to
use chemical and biological weapons, they've proven it historically. We
believe they have the capability now. Clearly, as we threaten the core of
the regime, which <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-15" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> and <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16888105 NGA:-3111895" id="Pl-37" latLong="34.597°N 43.677°E" state="SD" type="PPL">Tikrit</PLACE> represent, we believe that the
likelihood of them using those weapons goes up.

In less than 24 hours, the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-10" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> 101st Airborne Division has driven <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518 NGA:-3102482" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE>
Fedayeen fighters from the key city of <PLACE CTV="CITY" country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897127 NGA:-3102873" id="Pl-25" latLong="31.992°N 44.351°E" state="NA" type="PPLA">Najaf</PLACE>, pushed north in a
several-pronged attack. The Army's 3rd Infantry has punched through
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16892923 NGA:-3107077" id="Pl-21" latLong="32.250°N 43.117°E" state="KA" type="PPLA">Karbala</PLACE>, meeting only light resistance from the Medina Republican Guard,
and moving along highway nine within 25 miles of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-16" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>. At the same
time, the Marines from the 1st Division have secured a key <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16895173 NGA:-3104827" id="Pl-38" latLong="31.000°N 47.417°E" type="BODYOFWATER">Tigris River</PLACE>

combat fighting ability of that light infantry <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-17" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE> division that was
supposed to be providing defense down there. At the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-11" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> Central Command
briefing this morning at the forward headquarters in <PLACE country="QA" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19214831 NGA:-785169" id="Pl-39" latLong="25.287°N 51.533°E" state="DW" type="PPLC">Doha</PLACE>, <PLACE country="QA" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-785517 IGDB:19214483" id="Pl-40" latLong="25.500°N 51.250°E" type="COUNTRY">Qatar</PLACE>, General
Vincent Brooks said that the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-12" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> would be continuing to approach

the regime now, and it will remain pointed at it,&quot; he said, &quot;until the
regime is gone.&quot; Judy.


 WOODRUFF 
Jamie, these descriptions of the weakening of the Republican Guard begin
to bring back memories of the first <PLACE form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18493586 NGA:-1506414" id="Pl-41" latLong="27.000°N 51.000°E" type="BODYOFWATER">Gulf</PLACE> War 12 years ago. Is there a
chance that coalition forces could, at this point, be overestimating the
strength of what's left of the opposition?


 MCINTYRE 
Well, they might be. And that might be a good thing. They are taking it
very cautiously. No one, again, they stress the most dangerous part of
this could be ahead. Could be urban combat. Could involve chemical
weapons. Could be the most loyal fighters left as they draw into <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="NGA:-3103581 IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-19" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>.
Could be a very dangerous time. They also are careful to point out that
even while they say that the division has been destroyed, they don't mean
every single person has been killed. Simply that its combat effectiveness
has been eliminated - Judy.


 WOODRUFF 
We notice they said they did not want to use the word destroyed, in fact,
they said let others do that. Jamie McIntyre at the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1472192 IGDB:1473192" id="Pl-35" latLong="38.871°N 77.056°W" state="VA" type="FAC">Pentagon</PLACE>.
