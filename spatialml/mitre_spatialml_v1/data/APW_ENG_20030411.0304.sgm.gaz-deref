The lawyer of former <PLACE country="ZM" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17693600 NGA:-2306400" id="Pl-6" latLong="15.000°S 30.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Zambian</PLACE> president Frederick Chiluba was
reprimanded by a <PLACE country="ZM" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17708139 NGA:-2291861" id="Pl-2" latLong="15.417°S 28.283°E" state="09" type="PPLC">Lusaka</PLACE> magistrate when his client failed to appear
in court on theft charges Friday.

Chiluba, who is accused of stealing millions of dollars while in
office, did not appear at the <PLACE country="ZM" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17708139 NGA:-2291861" id="Pl-3" latLong="15.417°S 28.283°E" state="09" type="PPLC">Lusaka</PLACE> magistrates court as scheduled
because he has filed an appeal to have case heard at a higher court.

Chiluba's lawyer, Chifumu Banda, told the court he had advised
Chiluba not to appear in court Friday, following an agreement with
the prosecution that the case be postponed for a month while the
appeal is considered.

``The matter is before this court and whether an accused person
wishes to request for an adjournment or they wish to be absent for
any other reason, such a request must be done here,'' said Magistrate
Christopher Shacifwa.

He said lawyers could not decide on postponements between themselves.

Shacifwa ordered Chiluba to appear in court on May 16.

Chiluba faces 65 counts of theft including that of 15 billion kwacha
(<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-9" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>$3 million) in cash from the <PLACE country="ZM" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17693600 NGA:-2306400" id="Pl-7" latLong="15.000°S 30.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Zambia</PLACE> National Commercial Bank in

He has denied the allegations.

Chiluba was <PLACE country="ZM" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17693600 NGA:-2306400" id="Pl-8" latLong="15.000°S 30.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Zambia</PLACE>'s first democratically elected president. He came
