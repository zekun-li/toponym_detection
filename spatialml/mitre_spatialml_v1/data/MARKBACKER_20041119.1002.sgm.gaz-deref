Well, it's mid-morning on the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208918467" id="Pl-3" type="RGN">East coast</PLACE> and I am sitting here
running numbers thru my head trying to figure out what's going to happen
in the Iron Bowl, which is just over 29 hours away.

The game is being played in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:154742 USGS:153742" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.210°N 87.569°W" state="AL" type="PPL">Tuscaloosa</PLACE>, which should be an advantage
to <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779775 IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-5" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" state="AL" type="CIVIL">Alabama</PLACE>. However, In the two times the game has been played in Bryant
Denny Stadium, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:113277 IGDB:114277" id="Pl-18" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> has won.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779775 IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-6" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" state="AL" type="CIVIL">Alabama</PLACE> has one of the stingiest defenses in the <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-27" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>, and were
ranked number one in overall defense as recently as last week.
Conversely, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:113277 IGDB:114277" id="Pl-19" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> has one of the most potent and balanced offensive
attacks in the <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-29" type="COUNTRY">nation</PLACE>. Also, I don't think <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779775 IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-12" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" state="AL" type="CIVIL">Bama</PLACE> has faced an attack with
two great runners, a great line, a poised QB and good receivers and a
tight end as well.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779775 IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-13" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" state="AL" type="CIVIL">Bama</PLACE> is missing it's starting offensive backfield from the start of
the season. The fact that they've won six games is a testament to the
coaching and heart of the players.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779775 IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-7" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" state="AL" type="CIVIL">Alabama</PLACE> simply cannot throw the football, which is a good thing,
because <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:113277 IGDB:114277" id="Pl-20" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE>'s defensive backfield is second to none. <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779775 IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-14" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" state="AL" type="CIVIL">Bama</PLACE> can run the
ball however. Unfortunately for them, with no passing game to keep the
defense honest, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:113277 IGDB:114277" id="Pl-21" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> will probably stack nine in the box, play man on
the corners, and dare <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779775 IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-15" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" state="AL" type="CIVIL">Bama</PLACE> to run, and I don't think they'll be able to
do it.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:113277 IGDB:114277" id="Pl-22" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> is also 9-0 when they score first. The Tuberville way is to
get one quick and early to get your crowd into it if you're at home and
to quiet the other team's crowd if you're on the road.

You can never tell what is going to happen in rivalry games. In this
exact game 15 years ago, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779775 IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-16" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" state="AL" type="CIVIL">Bama</PLACE> came into <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:113277 IGDB:114277" id="Pl-23" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> #2 in the <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-26" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>,
undefeated at 10-0 and looking for yet another <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-30" type="COUNTRY">national</PLACE> championship.
They were summarily trounced 30-20 in a game in which the score was
closer than the actual game. That could very well happen Saturday.

I always tell people that the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1705317 IGDB:1706317" id="Pl-1" latLong="32.750°N 83.500°W" state="GA" type="CIVIL">Georgia</PLACE> game matters more to me than
the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779775 IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-17" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" state="AL" type="CIVIL">Bama</PLACE> game. I live in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1705317 IGDB:1706317" id="Pl-2" latLong="32.750°N 83.500°W" state="GA" type="CIVIL">Georgia</PLACE>, and losing that game affects me much
more directly than losing the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779775 IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-8" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" state="AL" type="CIVIL">Alabama</PLACE> game. That said, when kickoff time
comes, you remember all the reasons that you hate <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779775 IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-9" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" state="AL" type="CIVIL">Alabama</PLACE> and their
dumbass haircuts and their detergent and toilet paper and their
houndstooth hats and their &quot;Bear this&quot; and &quot;Bear that,&quot; and everything
else that goes along with it. This isn't a football game, and it's not
two drunken cousins fighting at a family reunion. This is brother
against brother after one slept with the other's wife and then bragged
about it. It's THAT serious.

However, when it's all said and done, I just don't think <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779775 IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-10" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" state="AL" type="CIVIL">Alabama</PLACE> has
the horses to stand up to what I believe is going to be enormous
defensive pressure. If <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:113277 IGDB:114277" id="Pl-24" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> takes care of the ball and executes, this
game shouldn't be as close as some think.

My call:

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:113277 IGDB:114277" id="Pl-25" latLong="32.610°N 85.481°W" state="AL" type="PPL">Auburn</PLACE> 37

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779775 IGDB:1780775" id="Pl-11" latLong="32.750°N 86.750°W" state="AL" type="CIVIL">Alabama</PLACE> 13

Now pass the Tums. I don't feel so well...

War Eagle!!
