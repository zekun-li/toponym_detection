<PLACE country="CZ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19456509 NGA:-543491" id="Pl-3" latLong="49.750°N 15.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Czech</PLACE> President Vaclav Klaus on Monday appointed Miroslav Kostelka as
the <PLACE country="CZ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:19456509 NGA:-543491" id="Pl-4" latLong="49.750°N 15.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>'s new defense minister to replace Jaroslav Tvrdik who
resigned from the post in late May.

The decision was made in response to the recommendation of Prime
Minister Vladimir Spidla.

Kostelka, 52, was first deputy defense minister and an ex- general.

At the end of last month, Tvrdik submitted his resignation in protest
against planned cuts in defense spending as part of the government's
finance reforms.

Under the planned package of public finance reforms, only 2.05
percent of the <PLACE country="CZ" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:19456509 NGA:-543491" id="Pl-5" latLong="49.750°N 15.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>'s gross domestic product (GDP) will be
allocated for the defense budget. Tvrdik said the military reform
could not be completed thoroughly with so little money.

Tvrdik, who took over the defense ministry in May 2001, also
announced that he would quit his post in the parliament and give up
his position in the ruling party Social Democrats.

Prime Minister Spidla said Monday that the ongoing military reform
should continue, with regard to the government's planned public
finance reforms.

The appointment marked the second change of the cabinet post since
the Spidla-led government came into power in July 2002.
