This is absolutely amazing news. Finally, the Democrats are finally
realizing that the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" type="COUNTRY">American</PLACE> people support the rights of unborn children
and may soon revamp their platform to accommodate the morals and values
that at least half of this country possesses. Of course, I'm sure the
Democrats would also like to start winning elections again. From the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1663328 USGS:1662328" id="Pl-2" latLong="34.052°N 118.243°W" state="CA" type="PPL">Los
Angeles</PLACE> Times : After long defining itself as an undisputed defender of
abortion rights, the Democratic Party is suddenly locked in an internal
struggle over whether to redefine its position to appeal to a broader
array of voters.

The fight is a central theme of the contest to head the Democratic
National, particularly between two leading candidates: former <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779802 IGDB:1780802" id="Pl-3" latLong="44.000°N 72.750°W" state="VT" type="CIVIL">Vermont</PLACE>
Gov. Howard Dean, who supports abortion rights, and former <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:449508 USGS:448508" id="Pl-4" latLong="40.000°N 86.250°W" state="IN" type="CIVIL">Indiana</PLACE> Rep.
Tim Roemer, an abortion foe who argues that the party cannot rebound
from its losses in the November election unless it shows more tolerance
on one of society's most emotional conflicts. No Democrat with any
respect for his unraveling party would ever mention Howard Dean's name
again. The fact that he didn't win a single primary outside his home
<PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="USGS:1779802 IGDB:1780802" id="Pl-5" latLong="44.000°N 72.750°W" state="VT" type="CIVIL">state</PLACE> shows that the <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE> does not embrace his radical liberalism.

Of course outspoken organizations such as Planned Parenthood, which
gives a lot of money to Democrats, will fight with everything they've
got to keep the Democratic platform as liberal as possible.

Results from the last few elections suggest that wouldn't be such a
good idea if they ever want to gain more power in Congress.
