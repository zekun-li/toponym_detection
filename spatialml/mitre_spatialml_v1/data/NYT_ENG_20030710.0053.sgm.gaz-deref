E-MAILS SHOW ANALYST PRIVATELY CRITICIZED HEALTHSOUTH

<TEXT>

As part of its investigation of the HealthSouth Corp., a
congressional committee released a second e-mail message on Thursday
by the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" id="Pl-1" state="NY" type="ROAD">Wall Street</PLACE> analyst who criticized the company just months
after giving its stock the highest possible rating.

The analyst, Howard G. Capek, resigned under pressure last week when
UBS executives discovered the first e-mail message.

In the e-mail message released on Thursday, written in August 1999,
Capek responded to a query asking him why HealthSouth's stock was
``acting like such a pig again.'' In his reply, he promised to send
``a few charts and graphs which should glaringly highlight the
company's inability to collect and convert sales into cash and also
their inability to reinvest cash at good rates of

accounting fraud, and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce is
investigating the company, the <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY">nation</PLACE>'s largest chain of
rehabilitation hospitals. The committee is also looking into UBS'
investment banking relationship with HealthSouth, and Capek an&amp;
two UBS investment bankers are expected to testify in September.

Members of the House committee also sent a letter to Capek in which
they told him that ``these e-mails raise questions about the extent
to which you truly believed that HealthSouth was a `strong buy,'''
and requested information about his correspondence on HealthSouth and
related companies.

``Certainly Mr. Capek has a lot of questions to answer,'' said Ken
Johnson, a spokesman for the committee, who said it was unclear why
the analyst was so bullish on the stock.

Thomas Fitzpatrick, Capek's lawyer, again emphasized that the e-mail
messages did not accurately represent Capek's views on HealthSouth.
``We welcome the opportunity to put these two e-mails in
perspective,'' Fitzpatrick said, ``and demonstrate from numerous
other e-mails that his private views on HealthSouth were totally
consistent with
hi;:164942292920914$29042:42:;72604662990329;292:42776 7729of this
nature.

In the first message released, written in September 1999, Capek told
an investor that ``he would not own a share'' in HealthSouth. ``We
need to speak on this,'' he said.

Capek had been viewed as extremely bullish on the company and was one
of the last analysts to downgrade the stock from a buy rating when
the shares plummeted in March.

The potential conflicts facing research analysts has received
substantial attention from regulators, and Henry Blodget, a former
analyst at Merrill Lynch, was recently barred from the securities
industry for his private criticism of stocks that he supported in
public.

Capek was forced to resign from UBS because he had discussed the
stock with a client at a time when HealthSouth and UBS were involved
in an investment banking deal that barred him from expressing any
view on the stock, UBS executives have said.

``We continue to cooperate with regulators,'' a UBS spokesman said,
``and we assume Howard Capek will cooperate as well.''

The committee also released minutes of a HealthSouth board meeting in
June 1999 that Capek had attended with William C. McGahan, the former
deputy for UBS' top health-care banker who has since left the firm
for personal reasons. The two were there to discuss ``Project
Mercury,'' a proposed spinoff of the company's inpatient operations,
according to the minutes.

That was the only HealthSouth board meeting Capek attended, his
lawyer said, and it was while he was clearly playing the role of
adviser. Regulators are investigating the research and investment
banking departments at UBS to determine whether the bank had a role
in HealthSouth's collapse.
