 <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> Supreme Court refuses to hear Moussaoui's appeal. 

The <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> Supreme Court has refused to hear Moussaoui's appeal. My
understanding of the ruling and history of the case from reading the
article goes like this:

Trial judge says M can have access to video monitored interviews of
al-Q captives.

Government says, "No way Jose as it threatens national security."

Judge says, "Fine, then you dont get to have the death penalty and
there can be no mention of 9-11."

Appeals Court says, "Hold on judgy-wudgy, we think you went too far.
The gummit can indeed protect national security by barring direct
contact with witnesses and we are putting their full case plus the
death penalty back in action. However, M does have a right to use
information favorable to his case, so you best draw up some summaries
of the witnesses' statements."

Judge says, "Okay, but I will want to see what conditions and
treatments these witnesses received while under interrogation."
