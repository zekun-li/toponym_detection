No enthusiasm

The Senate Courts Committee this afternoon killed Delegate Dick
Black's bill that would have required adoption authorities to ascertain
whether prospective adoptive adults had ever engaged in homosexual
behavior. There was no vote. The bill died for lack of a motion. Or lack
of emotion. Or lack of interest. Or of boredom. There just seemed to be
very little support for this....zzzzzz.

NBC-12 in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1500957" id="Pl-1" latLong="37.554°N 77.461°W" state="VA" type="PPLA">Richmond</PLACE> reported it went down on an unrecorded voice vote
... I suppose that's not materially different from your report, but
Black wanted a recorded vote and didn't get it.

It's not a profile in courage to avoid a recorded vote.

Certainly not - but I think it trumps giving Black satisfaction of
being able to slap the "anti-family!" on tolerant legislators.

What's important to realize is that Black's "scientists" were given
no credence whatsoever. They lacked credibilty. The failure of this bill
was a small glimmer of hope in what has been a dismal season.
