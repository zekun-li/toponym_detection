The troubled nuclear power plant in <PLACE country="CZ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19443411" id="Pl-5" latLong="49.200°N 14.350°E" state="JC" type="PPL">Temelin</PLACE> received permission from
state authorities Monday to start power production at full capacity.

Pavel Pitterman, the spokesman for the State Office for Nuclear
Safety, said his office gave the plant permission to run its second,
newer 1,000-megawatt unit at full capacity. The plant's first
1,000-megawatt unit has already operated at full capacity during past
tests.

The spokesman for the <PLACE country="CZ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19443411" id="Pl-6" latLong="49.200°N 14.350°E" state="JC" type="PPL">Temelin</PLACE> plant, Milan Nebesar, said that an
18-month trial production at full capacity at the second unit, needed
to declare the unit ready for commercial production, would start
Friday.

The plant, based on <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-7" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Russian</PLACE> design and upgraded with <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-8" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> technology,
has been plagued by frequent, non-nuclear malfunctions since testing
began in November 2000.

Located <SIGNAL id="S-1">just 60 kilometers (35 miles)</SIGNAL> <SIGNAL id="S-2">north</SIGNAL> of the <PLACE country="AT" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18025553" id="Pl-10" latLong="47.333°N 13.333°E" mod="BR" type="COUNTRY">Austrian</PLACE> border,
it has been a source of friction between the two countries.

Critics in non-nuclear <PLACE country="AT" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:18025553" id="Pl-9" latLong="47.333°N 13.333°E" type="COUNTRY">Austria</PLACE> argue the plant is unsafe and demand
that it be shut down, but <PLACE country="CZ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19456509" id="Pl-3" latLong="49.750°N 15.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Czech</PLACE> authorities insist the plant is safe.

The plant's first unit, currently shut down for planned maintenance
scheduled to take two months, has already entered the last stage of
tests and should be ready for commercial use at the end of 2003.
