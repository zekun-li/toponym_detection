Iraqis Mistakenly Believe Soldiers Have Sights on Sacred Landmark

 MILES O'BRIEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT 
Thanks very much, Judy. And Colonel Leonhard, we're going to talk a
little bit about urban combat. And I wanted to just start this off by
saying a lot of people when they hear about urban combat, they think of
that Blackhawk down scenario, <PLACE country="SO" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16772563" id="Pl-5" latLong="2.067°N 45.367°E" state="BN" type="PPLC">Mogadishu</PLACE> and the problems that can go
wrong here. This is not probably a comparable situation, is it?


 LT. COL. ROBERT LEONHARD, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> ARMY (RET.) 
Not in any way. And one of the reasons is because we have armored
fighting vehicles there in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-3" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>, and we will use them. Those tanks
have 120-millimeter smoothbore gun on them. The Bradleys have
25-millimetre chain guns and coaxial machine guns. That's a lot of mobile
protective gunfire. Completely different from the <PLACE country="SO" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16772563" id="Pl-6" latLong="2.067°N 45.367°E" state="BN" type="PPLC">Mogadishu</PLACE> situation in
which we did not have such vehicles. And we also are not going to use
similar tactics there. We are much more likely to use patience and
finesse rather than assault tactics.


 O'BRIEN 
All right. We want to show you an animation, and share with our viewers,
maybe you can point out a few things about this. If we move in on
<PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>, and give you a sense of the kinds of targets that might be
encountered in urban combat. What we've depicted here is something here
which shows some armor sort of off the wings here, right over here is a
mosque. We depict that to show that's something you obviously want to
stay clear as we just saw with the Ryan Chilcote piece from <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897127" id="Pl-7" latLong="31.992°N 44.351°E" state="NA" type="PPLA">Najaf</PLACE>. As we
get a little bit closer here, in a typical scenario like this, you might
very well have Republican Guard snipers up on balconies like this, and
possibly up on the roofs of buildings and anti-aircraft artillery or
artillery encampments like that. What we have presented her is an armored
column with air support coming in. How much jeopardy is a column like
this in as it goes through these concrete canyons in a city?


 LEONHARD 
It's a great question. I think the animation is good because it does show
that you can hide literally anywhere in a city environment, and that is
why movement through an urban area is very, very dangerous. It's the side
that's moving that's going to take the casualties. That said, the armored
fighting vehicles that you see there they look to me as if they're moving
a little bit faster as than we probably will. We'll use patience and
finesse. We will take the time to locate the enemy, surround the blocks
and the buildings that he is in. And then we'll probably surge fires into
their both lethal and nonlethal to make his position untenable, to make
him move rather than us moving through the assault zone. At which time we
can engage them or arrest them.


 O'BRIEN 
We'd like to resume with that animation if we could. That's Saddam
International Airport. That's another segment. Can we get back to the
animation. And I'd like to just finish this out. Here we go. Ad we move
it along, you'll see eventually the troops will come marching in. In this
case, slightly off target here because you see them all going in the
front door. Typically, when they'd assault a target like this, they'd do
what?


 LEONHARD 
Well, typically, if they do go in, which is generally the option of last
resort, but if we do have to go in, often we'll try to go in from the top
of the building down. One of the reasons is because we use grenades a lot
in clearing buildings, and grenades ten to offend downhill rather than
uphill. So, you always want them going down staircases rather than having
to try to throw them up the staircase.


 O'BRIEN 
Interesting, all right. Gravity rules, even in urban combat. Lieutenant
Colonel Robert Leonard, we appreciate your insights in urban combat,
something that is not something that the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> military would prefer to
engage in, but it might become inevitable. Thank you very much for your
time. We appreciate it -- Judy.


 WOODRUFF 
Thank you, Miles and thank you Colonel Leonhard. All of that certainly
helps us visualize what might happen. President Bush vows a final push to
victory and he mourns the loss of fallen Marines. Up next, a report on
the president's trip to Camp Lejeune, and a look at how the Camp Lejeune
community is coping with the challenges of war.
