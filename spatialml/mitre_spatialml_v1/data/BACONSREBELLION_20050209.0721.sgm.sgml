Earth &amp; Sky , a program that airs on NPR, featured a Virginia Tech
chemist this morning. Karen Brewer is working to develop a hydrogen
generation system "that's energy efficient, inexpensive, clean and
renewable." Wonder what she thought of Larry Summer's remarks on women
and science ....

Maybe some day we'll be stuck in traffic in hydrogen-powered cars.

I wonder what the tolls on the Dulles Toll Road would be by that day?

New solar + new nanotechnology + new fule cell technology + new
distribution technology

The components are there if we can get the power companies to quit
their lobbying and opposition.

States like New Jersey are putting solar on school roofs and allowing
those schools to earn money even during the summer when they are closed.
Virginia is falling behind when we should be ahead with schools like
Tech developing the technology.

The hydrogen tax will pay for MagLev all over Virginia.
