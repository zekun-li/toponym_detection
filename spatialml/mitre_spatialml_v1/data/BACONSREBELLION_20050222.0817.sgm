Two Reactions, Two Worlds

Del. Adam Ebbin (D, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1493456" id="Pl-1" latLong="38.805°N 77.047°W" state="VA" type="PPL">Alexandria</PLACE>) is the first openly gay member to
serve in the House of Delegates. There's a brief profile of Ebbin by
Kristen Gelineau in today's Daily Press . What I found interesting was
the contrast in reactions to Ebbin from two colleagues: "I suppose that
one of the concerns was that since he is the only openly gay member of
the Legislature, is whether or not that would be the only issue that he
would ... talk about," said Del. Ward Armstrong, D-<PLACE country="US" county="Henry County" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1503770" id="Pl-2" latLong="36.667°N 79.883°W" state="VA" type="CIVIL">Henry County</PLACE>. "That
clearly has not been the case. He is a very versatile delegate."

Del. Richard Black, R-<PLACE country="US" county="Loudoun" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1501160" id="Pl-3" latLong="39.006°N 77.429°W" state="VA" type="PPL">Loudoun</PLACE>, who has compiled a track record as one
of the most socially conservative members of the state legislature and
was the sponsor of the gay adoption bill, said he's not trying to stamp
out gay rights but is simply trying to preserve tradition.

As for his personal feelings on Ebbin, after a lengthy pause, the
<PLACE country="US" county="Loudoun" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1501160" id="Pl-4" latLong="39.006°N 77.429°W" state="VA" type="PPL">Loudoun</PLACE> Republican offered: "He's always prompt and, you know, on time
to meetings." A moment later, he added, "I think he works hard." I think
it's possible to support some of Black's positions but still be very
disappointed by his cold assessment of a colleague.

Dick Black is a statesman.

Odd how different our perceptions are. I read Black's comment as more
genuine and straightforward than Armstrong's. I'd much rather someone
call me "prompt" and "hard-working" than "very versatile." The latter
sounds like weasel words -- "Well," Johnnie's teacher said, "he's not
too bright, and his table manners are atroctious, but he's very
versatile."

Maybe it was the pointed reference of the reporter to the pauses
Black made that troubled me.

I appreciate your take on it; that's why I love this comment section.
I may be way off-base.

The Ward Armstrong comment is incredibly idiotic as well...
