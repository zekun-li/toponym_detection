One of the toughest jobs in <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-6" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraq</PLACE> right now is that of the military
doctor. CNN medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, has been traveling
with the Devil Docs throughout the war and now they are close to <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-1" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>.

 SANJAY GUPTA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over) 
Each of these bangs and explosions comes with a story. Some we'll never
know. For others, the stories can be seen in their injuries. Nobody knows
these stories better than the Devil Docs, Naval corpsmen who never look
the other way, but rather face what needs to be done without flinching.
They are often the first faces the injured see, be they <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16897518" id="Pl-7" latLong="33.000°N 44.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iraqi</PLACE> or
coalition force members. Even while statutes were coming down and there
was dancing in the streets, the consequences of continuing firefights are
seen here. The work of the Devil Docs is by no means over. The Navy has
set up a helicopter landing zone just a 100 meters from a mobile
operating room, just on the outskirts of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-2" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>. This is the closest
front line surgical company. Corpsmen quickly take patients by ambulance
away from the blowing sand to a triage tent. It is there the doctors
begin their work. Over 45 minutes as we watched, 32 patients were
delivered here, evaluated and nine operations started; 29 of those
delivered, Marines involved in a firefight in the center of <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-3" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" mod="C" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>.
Their stories could be seen in the shrapnel wounds of rocket-propelled
grenades and bullet wounds from semi-automatic weapons. The operations
are on their hands, abdomen and face. Two of the Marines, too far gone.
For many of the survivors, that news is the most difficult to handle.
Along with the medical care, hands are held, spirits are lifted. Dr.
Sanjay Gupta, CNN with the Devil Docs outside <PLACE country="IQ" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16896419" id="Pl-4" latLong="33.339°N 44.394°E" mod="C" state="BG" type="PPLC">Baghdad</PLACE>.
