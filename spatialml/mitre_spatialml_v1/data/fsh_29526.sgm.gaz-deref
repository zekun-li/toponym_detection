9. Elections Did you vote in the recent <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-1" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> Presidential election?
What did you think of the two candidates, George Bush and John Kerry?
What about the Vice Presidential candidates, Dick Cheney and John
Edwards?  What issues were most important to you in deciding who to
vote for?  If you didn't vote, why not?


 Marco 
Hello, it's Marco from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779784 IGDB:1780784" id="Pl-7" latLong="40.000°N 89.250°W" state="IL" type="CIVIL">Illinois</PLACE>.


 Derek 
Hello, this is Derek from <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1384879 IGDB:1385879" id="Pl-8" latLong="30.267°N 97.743°W" state="TX" type="PPLA">Austin</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779801 IGDB:1780801" id="Pl-9" latLong="31.250°N 99.250°W" state="TX" type="CIVIL">Texas</PLACE>.


 Marco 
Oh.  Dan, did you say?


 Derek 
Derek.


 Marco 
Derek.


 Derek 
Yeah.


 Marco 
Hi, nice to meet you.


 Derek 
Yeah, you too.


 Marco 
Um


 Derek 
How's it going?


 Marco 
Good, good.  So, uh the election, um -- the, um -- let's see, overall I
felt -- ju- just give you a brief -- summary, I felt -- that -- John Kerry and
Edwards were were pretty strong candidates and -- uh -- mm, I don't know,
I guess just in terms of policy I didn't -- I didn't, uh, find -- that as
compelling as just -- the personality of -- the different candidates.


 Derek 
Yeah.


 Marco 
felt like I could trust Kerry -- uh, little bit more even though he was
much more of a politician than Bush.


 Derek 
Mhm.  Mhm.


 Marco 
Uh, he was -- kind of a smooth talker and


 Derek 
Mhm.


 Marco 
Um -- uh -- seems like a politician, they way he presented


 Derek 
Mhm.


 Marco 
his you know his his um argument.  But -- uh -- strangely I felt like that
what, that was -- one of -- one of his good qualities because I didn't
feel Bush was politician enough.  That um -- one of the -- issues that I
was concerned about was just -- the representation of the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-5" type="COUNTRY">United States</PLACE>
and -- on the international stage


 Derek 
Sure.


 Marco 
and I just -- uh -- I uh -- I don't know, uh, Bush is -- the way he presents
um -- the ~<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-2" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> position -- uh -- seemed a little -- abrasive to me.


 Derek 
Mhm.


 Marco 
And I -- felt like, hm -- if we're trying to, um -- make -- um -- the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" type="COUNTRY">United
States</PLACE> safer and more stable -- conflict in the world more stable then
we probably need somebody -- who is a little bit more -- of a politician
in the sense that -- the, they care about diplomacy and -- uh, even though
we may not -- give in to -- the will of the other nations present it in a
nicer way.


 Derek 
Mhm.


 Marco 
Yeah, it seems ((I make)) kind of simplistic, but -- that was -- an
important thing for me.  Uh


 Derek 
Yeah.


 Marco 
Yeah.


 Derek 
Um -- I was a little different. I I I agree with everything you said.  I
just, um -- I come from a little different background as far as being -- I
was never into politics and now I I actually have gotten into God much
more and and, you know, searching spirituality out.


 Marco 
Uh huh.


 Derek 
Generally people like that are conservative, you know,


 Marco 
Yeah.


 Derek 
uh, with their views because of different things like abortion and,
and, uh, pro-life and -- all that kind of thing so I came form that
background


 Marco 
Uh huh.


 Derek 
eh, but that was just an added bonus for me in the fact that -- I too
was obviously at this point in time concerned about the welfare of our
security -- and I felt personally that if -- Kerry was in office we'd kind
of be, uh -- up a creek without a paddle because I think -- he is so laid
back -- um, and not as aggressive as Bush that at this point in the
game, where we're at -- we're in this thing full full -- steam ahead


 Marco 
Uh huh.


 Derek 
and for a transition to occur at this point -- to someone who is laid
back -- and not as aggressive as him I think would actually endanger the
~<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-3" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE> even more.


 Marco 
Yeah.


 Derek 
I think that the international, uh uh, leaders would look at Kerry and
know, they're very smart, I mean they're -- they're on top of these
things, they know, you know, it would , it just would have opened a
gateway.


 Marco 
Uh huh.


 Derek 
I feel


 Marco 
Yeah.


 Derek 
that, uh, it may have actually put us in more danger. At least Bush
has -- pulled out the gun, you know, stick to them, and um -- you know,
that's where I was coming from on that.


 Marco 
Yeah.


 Derek 
And then when I


 Marco 
((Do you think))


 Derek 
I listen to a lot of talk radio and when I heard the stuff about Kerry
back in the -- the the, apparently the scandals he's pulled as far as
the uh, medals when he served time.


 Marco 
Uh huh.


 Derek 
You know, uh -- I listen to a lot of talk radio and spoke with, you
know, heard from a lot of, uh -- veterans -- and they said it was
physically, uh, impossible for him to achieve what he said he did.


 Marco 
Uh huh.  Uh huh.


 Derek 
And all the meetings he's missing, and just, you know, I think it's
more of a status quo for him.


 Marco 
Yeah.


 Derek 
I think he's more, he got so much money that I think he was just
concerned with attaining this position and a title.


 Marco 
Yeah.


 Derek 
you know ((flag)) for him, so


 Marco 
Do you think, um -- the -- when the Republicans are campaigning -- they were
saying that well, another attack on the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-10" type="COUNTRY">U.S.</PLACE> is -- imminent, that it
probably -- probably going to happen -- and -- um -- and -- they even went so
far to say that if -- it's really difficult to prevent something like
this and of course they're doing the best they can and -- I think Kerry
would do the best he could.  But do you think, um -- that -- and this
isn't quite a political issue, but do you think that -- there's going to
be another attack on the ~<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" type="COUNTRY">US</PLACE>?  Uh like in the next five years?
Something big like -- the world (())


 Derek 
I, I don't know what your beliefs are, as far as, uh -- biblically or
spiritually or whatever, but -- I believe it's inevitable. I mean, we're
going down, you know? And, yeah, and this is, all these things have
been written about actually.


 Marco 
Really?


 Derek 
Um -- The tw- the uh -- what is it, the towers, uh -- that was actually uh
there's references to that in the bible.


 Marco 
Yeah, I've heard, I've heard about that.
