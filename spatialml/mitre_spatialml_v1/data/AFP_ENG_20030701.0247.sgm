Former <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-2" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Russian</PLACE> aluminum baron Anatoly Bykov was convicted Tuesday of
covering up the murder of a business rival and then immediately
amnestied in court, Interfax reported.

Bykov had initially been charged with organizing the murder of Oleg
Gubin in <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16995911" id="Pl-16" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" state="NVS" type="RGN">Siberia</PLACE>'s <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17063317" id="Pl-12" latLong="58.000°N 93.000°E" state="KIA" type="CIVIL">Krasnoyarsk region</PLACE>, which has seen several
high-profile slayings allegedly linked to a fight for control of the
area's vast mineral wealth.

The court changed the charge sheet against Bykov in the course of the
trial. He was sentenced to a one year prison term and then amnestied
in court, the Interfax report said.

It was the second time Bykov was set free after a trial focusing on
his links to assassination attempts against his <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17063317" id="Pl-13" latLong="58.000°N 93.000°E" state="KIA" type="CIVIL">Krasnoyarsk</PLACE> rivals.

A <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17039439" id="Pl-6" latLong="55.752°N 37.616°E" state="MOS" type="PPLC">Moscow</PLACE> court last year upheld a six-and-a-half year suspended
sentence for the attempted murder of another Bykov rival, Vilor
Struganov, who had been a business partner of the aluminium baron.

Bykov was convicted of ordering a failed assasination attempt on
September 29, 2000, against Struganov -- alias "Pasha the Strobe
Light," who is described as one of the mafia chiefs of <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17063317" id="Pl-14" latLong="58.000°N 93.000°E" state="KIA" type="CIVIL">Krasnoyarsk</PLACE>.

Ex-boxer Bykov became one of the most powerful men in the <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17063317" id="Pl-15" latLong="58.000°N 93.000°E" state="KIA" type="CIVIL">Krasnoyarsk
region</PLACE> in the 1990s when he took control of the aluminum giant KrAz.

He was ousted as head of KrAZ -- <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-3" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Russia</PLACE>'s second largest aluminum
smelter, which is now part of Oleg Deripaska's RusAl conglomerate --
shortly after falling foul of former <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17063317" id="Pl-11" latLong="58.000°N 93.000°E" state="KIA" type="CIVIL">Krasnoyarsk</PLACE> governor Alexander
Lebed, who died in a helicopter crash in April 2002.

Bykov, who enjoyed tremendous popularity in the <PLACE country="RU" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:17063317" id="Pl-17" latLong="58.000°N 93.000°E" state="KIA" type="CIVIL">region</PLACE> despite his
own alleged mafia ties, had supported Lebed's gubernatorial campaign.

But he fled to <PLACE country="HU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19143844" id="Pl-20" latLong="47.000°N 20.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Hungary</PLACE> after Lebed turned on him and attempted to
install his own associates as KrAZ directors, as part of a campaign
to clean up business practices in the mineral-rich <PLACE country="RU" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:17063317" id="Pl-19" latLong="58.000°N 93.000°E" state="KIA" type="CIVIL">region</PLACE>.

Extradited to <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-4" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Russia</PLACE> in 2000 on charges of money laundering and
several murders, Bykov was released on August 24 2002.

He said the charges were intended to force him to give up his
20-percent stake in KrAz.
