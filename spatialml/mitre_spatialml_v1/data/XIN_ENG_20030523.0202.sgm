The <PLACE country="PH" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17554385" id="Pl-3" latLong="13.000°N 122.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Philippine</PLACE> Presidential Palace Friday dismissed as an "old tune"
deposed leader Joseph Estrada's claim that he was still the <PLACE country="PH" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:17554385" id="Pl-5" latLong="13.000°N 122.000°E" type="COUNTRY">country</PLACE>'s
legitimate president.

Presidential Chief of Staff Rigoberto Tiglao said Estrada's camp was
trying to revive the issue on the legality of President Gloria
Macapagal-Arroyo's administration when this was upheld twice by the
Supreme Court.

"This is an old tune as far as the Palace is concerned," Tiglao said
hours after Estrada petitioned the anti-graft court, the
Sandiganbayan, to dismiss the government charges against him, citing
"lack of jurisdiction" since he was still the president.

Meanwhile, the court shrugged off the claim of Estrada's lawyer Alan
Paguia that its ruling on the legitimacy of the Arroyo administration
was illegal and cautioned that the tribunal's decision was final and
could not be overturned by the Sandiganbayan.

The Sandiganbayan Special Division Friday reset for June 16 the
resumption of Estrada's plunder case hearing, which was originally
scheduled for June 2.

Estrada, who was ousted in a military-backed popular revolt in
January 2001, has been detained for almost two years at the Veterans
Memorial Medical Center in <PLACE country="PH" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17560232" id="Pl-2" latLong="14.583°N 121.000°E" state="00" type="CIVIL">Metro Manila</PLACE> on plunder charges.
