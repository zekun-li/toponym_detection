Many of the good-governiks who write for Bacon's Rebellion have
pointed out the deleterious effects of gerrymandering on <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779803 IGDB:1780803" id="Pl-2" latLong="37.500°N 78.500°W" state="VA" type="CIVIL">Virginia</PLACE>. Some
would say the problems are on display in Capitol Square right now.

There's an anti-gerrymandering movement gaining a small head of steam
in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778 USGS:1779778" id="Pl-3" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="CA" type="CIVIL">California</PLACE>. The <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778 USGS:1779778" id="Pl-5" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="CA" type="CIVIL">Golden State</PLACE> often leads the way for the <PLACE country="US" form="NOM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-6" type="COUNTRY">nation</PLACE> on
&quot;reform,&quot; for good or ill. Mickey Kaus of Slate reminds us that the
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1780778 USGS:1779778" id="Pl-4" latLong="37.250°N 119.750°W" state="CA" type="CIVIL">California</PLACE> initiative bears watching and we should follow the motives of
those who support or oppose the current redistricting process.

Mickey cites two Stuart Taylor articles on the subject that should be
required reading for any who would debate the issue, here and here .

Hand in hand with any consideration of the redistricting process, we
shoul give some thought to the structural relationship between the state
House and Senate. Currently, each House member represents approximately
75,000 Virginians, while each Senator represents appoximately 187,500.
Often as not, there is no rational commonality between the two. Some
senators represent people pools that are in turn fractured into five or
six House districts. I believe this accounts, in large part, for the
dysfunction that characterizes our state government now. Former Governor
Gerald Baliles, in this same vein, has advocated a realignment of the
two houses in a way that serves commonalities. He has suggested that we
either increase membership in the Senate to 50, or decrease House
membership to 80, producing a scenario wherein 1 Senator would represent
a block of people who are represented by exactly 2 Delegates. He
thinks--and I think he is right--that this arrangement would foster a
closer working relationship between the Senate and the House. You
certainly wouldn't have these dysfunctional groupings we now have, where
1 Senator often represents a population divided among half a dozen
Delegates of two parties--three, if you count independents.
