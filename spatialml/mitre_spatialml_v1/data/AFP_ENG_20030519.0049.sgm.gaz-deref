MCI, formerly WorldCom, and the Securities and Exchange Commission
have reached a final agreement in the telecom giant's
11-billion-dollar (9.4-billion-euro) fraud case, The <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208991647" id="Pl-1" state="NY" type="ROAD">Wall Street</PLACE>
Journal reported Monday.

Under terms of the agreement, to be submitted as early as Monday to a
judge presiding over the case, MCI would agree to pay the largest
fine imposed so far by the SEC on a company that is not a
broker-dealer, the Journal said, citing sources close to the matter.

The report did not give the amount of the fine, but said it would be
&quot;exponentially larger&quot; than the historic 10 million dollars Xerox
paid the SEC last year.

Last month, the SEC slapped fines totaling 1.4 billion dollars on 10
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:208991647" id="Pl-2" state="NY" type="ROAD">Wall Street</PLACE> brokerages to settle charges of conflicts of interest
between analysts and investors.

MCI and the SEC negotiated the agreement for months after a partial
settlement in November under which MCI, formerly known as WorldCom,
agreed not to mislead investors about its finances, and to improve
internal controls, the Journal said.

The estimated value of the fraud has reached historic proportions,
swelling from the initially announced 3.5 million dollars to 11
million dollars as revelations of misconduct piled on, the report
said.

Separately, former WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers failed on April 29 to
make a first repayment of 25 million dollars, plus interest, on a
400-million-dollar loan from MCI, the Journal said, citing SEC
documents.

Because he is now in default MCI must now seize additional assets
owned by Ebbers, to secure the loan. The company has already sold his

bring 60 to 70 million dollars, the Journal said.
