The lawyer for a <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-2" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Russian</PLACE> military journalist convicted of treason
filed an appeal Wednesday in an effort to overturn the guilty verdict
against his client, who was released on parole earlier this year,
news agencies reported.

Grigory Pasko's lawyer Genri Reznik filed the appeal with <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-3" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Russian</PLACE>
Supreme Court, the Interfax and ITAR-Tass news agencies reported. He
asked the court to invalidate the verdict and throw out the criminal
case against Pasko, they said.

Pasko was sentenced to four years in prison in December 2001 for
illegally attending a meeting of top military commanders and taking
notes there. A military court said he intended to pass the notes to
<PLACE country="JP" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:19768770" id="Pl-6" latLong="36.000°N 138.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Japanese</PLACE> media with which he had worked.

Pasko, whose sentence included time served, was released in January
for good behavior after serving more than two-thirds of the sentence.
He has maintained his innocence, saying the military was punishing
him for exposing environmental abuses by the <PLACE country="RU" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:17005945" id="Pl-4" latLong="60.000°N 100.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Russian</PLACE> navy, including
the dumping of radioactive waste into the sea.

Reznik said an initial appeal he lodged the day Pasko was freed never
reached the presidium of the Supreme Court, according to Interfax.
The lawyer said the court's military board had refused to launch
proceedings on the appeal.

Reznik said he addressed the new appeal directly to Supreme Court
Chairman Vyacheslav Lebedev and asked that it not be considered by
military judges ``because the military justice system has adopted a
biased attitude against Pasko,'' Interfax reported.
