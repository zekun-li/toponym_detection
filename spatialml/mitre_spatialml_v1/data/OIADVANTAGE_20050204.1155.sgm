Yesterday was a tough day for the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1513650" id="Pl-1" latLong="47.606°N 122.331°W" state="WA" type="PPL">Seattle</PLACE> scene. Amazon ended the day
down 14.6%. Starbucks down 8.2%. I should disclose that I spent a few
years living in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1513650" id="Pl-2" latLong="47.606°N 122.331°W" state="WA" type="PPL">Seattle</PLACE> and I have a soft spot in my heart for all
things <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:1513650" id="Pl-3" latLong="47.606°N 122.331°W" state="WA" type="PPL">Seattle</PLACE>. As far as I could tell, many people in the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-4" mod="NW" type="COUNTRY">Northwest</PLACE>
spend the mornings drinking lattes and their evenings drinking
microbrews. Really not a bad lifestyle.

Anyway, back on topic here. Market over reaction? Hard to say. Both
companies have pricey stocks and those valuations are based on
optimistic expectations of future growth. Yesterday's news led many to
question their growth assumptions for these companies. Today I want to
talk a bit about Starbucks. I think I have to start by acknowledging
that the stock is still pricey even after its drop yesterday. However,
my organizational indicators analysis reveals a very low level of
business risk . This may partially justify a higher P/E ratio. A couple
weeks ago, I observed that Wal-Mart had offsetting strong and weak
organizational indicators . Starbucks, on the other hand, has uniformly
strong organizational indicators. Starbucks scores as best in its
industry on six of seven organizational indicators. Not surprising are
its strong scores in the employee relations and stakeholder actions
indicators. Its weakest score is in the external reporting indicator. In
the past, several observers have raised concerns about aggressive
accounting at Starbucks but my analysis does not indicate any systematic
current issues. The weak score is primarily the result of Starbucks
current strategy of increasing equity ownership of several foreign
subsidiaries. This is a strategic shift that has short-term costs and
adds some uncertainty to the financial statements.

Beyond the strong Organizational Indicator analysis, several
additional factors favor Starbucks ability to continue to grow revenues.

1. Starbucks has little debt. Starbucks is not currently financing
its growth with debt. Considering its growth, this is amazing. It also
means that Starbucks has a large amount of flexibility in how it
finances future growth. The company can assume much more debt without
negatively affecting its risk profile because...

2. Starbucks has a healthy cashflow and current cash position. This
allows the company to grow without debt. You could argue that Starbucks
has too much cash and should do more to pass it on to shareholders. This
option is another way that Starbucks has retained its flexibility for
the future.

3. Starbucks is the primary owner of its stores and limits
franchising. While Starbucks does partner (airlines, airports, Barnes
&amp; Noble), most of its stores are company owned. From a managerial
perspective this greatly simplifies cost structures, product changes,
and quality control.

Taken together all of these factors paint a picture of a company with
a very strong future. I cannot say if these factors justify the current
share price but I would say that they justify a higher P/E ratio than
the industry norm. Risk is lower.

Interesting aside: Starbucks is taking over the location in my town
that was recently abandoned by Krispy Kreme.

Disclosure: At the time of this writing I do not own Starbucks
stock...but I am tempted and might consider a buy next week. I am also
tempted to go buy a latte after writing this post.
