 waiver of extradition means what 

My girlfriend was on the run from probation in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:294478 IGDB:295478" id="Pl-1" latLong="28.750°N 82.500°W" state="FL" type="CIVIL">Fla</PLACE> when she got herself in
trouble here in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779777 IGDB:1780777" id="Pl-5" latLong="34.500°N 111.500°W" state="AZ" type="CIVIL">Az</PLACE>. which apparantly, true to her habits, she tried to
avoid by not showing up for court. Time goes by, we meet etc etc she gets
herself under the scrutiny of the police and into jail again.

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:294478 IGDB:295478" id="Pl-7" latLong="28.750°N 82.500°W" state="FL" type="CIVIL">fla</PLACE> trouble 1999 she signed a waiver of extradition as part of her plea
deal

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779777 IGDB:1780777" id="Pl-8" latLong="34.500°N 111.500°W" state="AZ" type="CIVIL">Az</PLACE> in trouble in 2001, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:294478 IGDB:295478" id="Pl-2" latLong="28.750°N 82.500°W" state="FL" type="CIVIL">fla</PLACE> is mentioned and she signs another waiver of
extradition, posts bonds and skips (not far enough apparantly)

<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779777 IGDB:1780777" id="Pl-9" latLong="34.500°N 111.500°W" state="AZ" type="CIVIL">Az</PLACE> troubles again in 2004, she serves 6 months , then the day before she is to
be released to do 5 yrs probation her in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779777 IGDB:1780777" id="Pl-10" latLong="34.500°N 111.500°W" state="AZ" type="CIVIL">az</PLACE>, <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:294478 IGDB:295478" id="Pl-3" latLong="28.750°N 82.500°W" state="FL" type="CIVIL">fla</PLACE> shows up and takes her to <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:294478 IGDB:295478" id="Pl-4" latLong="28.750°N 82.500°W" state="FL" type="CIVIL">fla</PLACE>
faceing her original 1999 charges which are still open (she failed miserably at
probation) I think they want to give her 3 years.

my question isa this, what the heck is a waiver of extradition good 4 ? How
will her probation be affected here? I ask around locally and no one will
reply, not her public defender, the public defenders office, so I guess this
is my last resource cuase I cannot afford to consult with an attorney.
Thanks in advance,
MLM
the guy who shoulda known better.............

 Re: waiver of extradition means what 

    

The waiver of extradition that she signed simply means that if she
skips out and goes to another state, she can't contest the right of
the original court to have her hauled back to its jurisdiction, and
that the court won't have to initiate the time-consuming process of
extraditing her. Instead, if the cops pick her up, she can be
shipped back without delay.

Might be time to find a new girlfriend... this one seems to have a
habit of ducking out when things get rough.

 Re: waiver of extradition means what 

    

She's going to have a lot of separate offenses to account for by this
time. 2 &quot;FTA&quot;s (failure to appear), one in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:294478 IGDB:295478" id="Pl-15" latLong="28.750°N 82.500°W" state="FL" type="CIVIL">FL</PLACE> and one in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779777 IGDB:1780777" id="Pl-11" latLong="34.500°N 111.500°W" state="AZ" type="CIVIL">AZ</PLACE>, plus
whatever the original
charges were in both cases.

    

That means she has given up the right to force the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:294478 IGDB:295478" id="Pl-16" latLong="28.750°N 82.500°W" state="FL" type="CIVIL">FL</PLACE> authorities to
go thru legal due process in demanding that the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779777 IGDB:1780777" id="Pl-12" latLong="34.500°N 111.500°W" state="AZ" type="CIVIL">AZ</PLACE> authorities turn
her over to them for further prosecution. All the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:294478 IGDB:295478" id="Pl-17" latLong="28.750°N 82.500°W" state="FL" type="CIVIL">FL</PLACE> prosecutors
have to do is ask, and the <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779777 IGDB:1780777" id="Pl-13" latLong="34.500°N 111.500°W" state="AZ" type="CIVIL">AZ</PLACE> jailers will pack her up in a van or a
plane and ship her back to <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:294478 IGDB:295478" id="Pl-18" latLong="28.750°N 82.500°W" state="FL" type="CIVIL">FL</PLACE> for trial on the FTA charge and probably
to commence her serving time under the suspended sentence that went
along with her original probation. She's in DEEP SH__T if you
haven't already figure that out.

    

Nowhere in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:840" id="Pl-21" type="COUNTRY">USA</PLACE> would be far enough if she waived extradition.

    

Of course they do. That's what her waiver of extradition meant they
could do. They let her serve her time in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779777 IGDB:1780777" id="Pl-14" latLong="34.500°N 111.500°W" state="AZ" type="CIVIL">AZ</PLACE>, then they come and get
her to serve her time in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:294478 IGDB:295478" id="Pl-19" latLong="28.750°N 82.500°W" state="FL" type="CIVIL">FL</PLACE>.

    

This is what happens when people blow off the chances they are given
to straighten out by being given probation. Thumb your nose at the
court often enough, and they will bring all sorts of crap down on your
head, re-instituting the original suspended sentences and possibly
adding on for the FTA.

    

What is it GOOD for? It's good for the STATE, not for the convict.
It lets them skip some of the legal procedures she would otherwise be
entitled to, in order to ship her from one state to another. But they
were entitled to demand that waiver as a condition of probation; if
she had not agreed to voluntarily waive that right, they probably
would have just thrown her in jail for the 3 year sentence the first
time around and she wouldn't have been given the chance to go straight
during probation and avoid jail altogether.

    

She doesn't have a lot of leeway here. She has done this numerous
times and they are not likely to give her another wide open chance
like they did the first 3 times. She will probably have to serve out
her sentence in <PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:294478 IGDB:295478" id="Pl-20" latLong="28.750°N 82.500°W" state="FL" type="CIVIL">FL</PLACE>, AND if she has not already served all her time in
<PLACE country="US" form="NAM" gazref="USGS:1779777 IGDB:1780777" id="Pl-22" latLong="34.500°N 111.500°W" state="AZ" type="CIVIL">AZ</PLACE>, they will then ship her back there to do THAT time.

Waitaminit, you said she DOES have a public defender? OK, he/she is
doing all they can, but that's not much, under the circumstances.
You're complaining that YOU can't get an atty? You don't need one.
And her attys will not talk to you because you are not entitled to
participate in their confidential communications with their client.
But won't your GF tell you these things? If not, maybe it's because
she doesn't want you to know either. Which you would then take into
account in deciding if you still want her to be your significant
other. Anyway, good luck,
