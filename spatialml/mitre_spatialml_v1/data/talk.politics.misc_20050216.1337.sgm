I wonder why the Army and Marines do not deploy infantry combat
drones.

That would be a long drive to any nuclear facility.
Someone's BOUND to notice.

Hmmm ... now if the drone aircraft could lift a drone
soldier and parachute ......

Oh well, I don't think there's really much we CAN do
about <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-4" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iranian</PLACE> nukes. Learning from others mistakes
they've widely dispersed their facilities, even put
some in dense urban areas. We will just have to lay
down the law relative to what HAPPENS if <PLACE country="IR" form="NAM" gazref="IGDB:16932748" id="Pl-5" latLong="32.000°N 53.000°E" type="COUNTRY">Iranian</PLACE>
uranium is found in a terrorist nuke.

Yep. The Persians aren't so dumb, are they? ;-)

But just how exactly would we ever be able to learn where fission
material came from forensically? Sounds like a fantasy...

As dangerous as this world is getting, we better think about being a
better neighbor. JMHO.
;D

Um ... you're not very technical, are you ?

Every reactor produces not only the fissionable
products you want for bombs but also certain
contaminates with a unique percentage of isotopes.
It's a "fingerprint" that would be really hard
to fake.

    

Sure ... but there are LIMITS ....

In article (Wd4WQiFzIix9QJjBx1YNVX2KX...@ 4ax.com), b...@barrk.net says...

    

Doesn't do you any good if you don't have a fingerprint on file to which
to compare the unknown one.

And does it work after the bomb has blown?

Please enlighten us.

Yes, it works even after the bomb has
exploded.

Ah ... but we DO ! We got it in two ways. First
from IAEC inspectors and secondly, in case some
fakery was going on, from our low-flying drones
that buzzed - and 'sniffed' - their facilities.
