    <h3>Introduction</h3> 

    
<p>This file contains documentation for ACE 2005 English SpatialML Annotations, 
  Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2008T03 and isbn 1-58563-458-1.</p>

    
<p>The ACE (Automatic Contact Extraction) program focuses on developing automatic 
content extraction technology to support automatic processing of human language 
in text form. The kind of information recognized and extracted from text includes 
entities, values, temporal expressions, relations and events. SpatialML is a mark-up 
language for representing spatial expressions in natural language documents. SpatialML's 
focus is primarily on geography and culturally-relevant landmarks, rather than 
biology, cosmology, geology, or other regions of the spatial language domain. 
The goal is to allow for potentially better integration of text collections with 
resources such as databases that provide spatial information about a domain, including 
gazetteers, physical feature databases and mapping services. In ACE 2005 English 
SpatialML Annotations, the authors applied SpatialML tags to the English training 
data (originally annotated for entities, relations and events) in <a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2006T06">ACE 
2005 Multilingual Training Corpus, LDC2006T06.</a></p> 
<p>The SpatialML annotation scheme is intended to emulate earlier progress on 
  time expressions such as <a href="http://fofoca.mitre.org/">TIMEX2</a>, <a href="http://www.timeml.org/site/">TimeML</a> 
  and the <a href="http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/ace/2005/doc/ace05eval_official_results_20060110.html">2005 
  ACE guidelines</a>. </p>
<p>The main SpatialML tag is the PLACE tag. The central goal of SpatialML is to 
  map PLACE information in text to data from gazetteers and other databases to 
  the extent possible. Therefore, semantic attributes such as country abbreviations, 
  country subdivision and dependent area abbreviations (e.g., US states), and 
  geo-coordinates are used to help establish such a mapping. LINK and PATH tags 
  express relations between places, such as inclusion relations and trajectories 
  of various kinds. Information in the tag along with the tagged location string 
  should be sufficient to uniquely determine the mapping, when such a mapping 
  is possible. This also means that redundant information is not included in the 
  tag.</p>
<p>To the extent possible, SpatialML leverages ISO and other standards towards 
  the goal of making the scheme compatible with existing and future corpora. The 
  SpatialML guidelines are compatible with existing guidelines for spatial annotation 
  and existing corpora within the ACE research program. In particular, the English 
  Annotation Guidelines for Entities (Version 5.6.6 2006.08.01) were exploited, 
  specifically the GPE, Location, and Facility entity tags, and the Physical relation 
  tags, all of which are mapped to SpatialML tags. Ideas were also borrowed from 
  Toponym Resolution Markup Language of Leidner (2006), the research of Schilder 
  et al. (2004) and the annotation scheme in Garbin and Mani (2005). Information 
  recorded in the annotation is compatible with the feature types in the Alexandria 
  Digital Library. This corpus also leverages the integrated gazetteer database 
  (IGDB) of Mardis and Burger (2005). Last but not least, this annotation scheme 
  can be related to the Geography Markup Language (GML) defined by the Open Geospatial 
  Consortium (OGC), as well as Google Earth's Keyhole Markup Language (KML), to 
  express geographical features.</p>
  
	<p>SpatialML goes beyond these schemes, however, in terms of providing a richer 
  markup for natural language that includes semantic features and relationships 
  that allow mapping to existing resources such as gazetteers. Such a markup can 
  be useful for (i) disambiguation, (ii) integration with mapping services, and 
  (iii) spatial reasoning. In relation to (iii), it is possible to use spatial 
  reasoning not only for integration with applications, but for better information 
  extraction, e.g., for disambiguating a place name based on the locations of 
  other place names in the document. SpatialML goes to some length to represent 
  topological relationships among places, derived from the RCC8 Calculus (Randell 
  et al. 1992, Cohn et al. 1997). </p>

  Annotation Scheme for Marking Spatial Expressions in Natural Lanugage,&quot; 
  which is included in the online documentation for this corpus.</p>
