    "sentence": "Controversial pastor picked for Mansfield patrol program. By Vickie Welborn vwelborn@gannett.com Gannett March 24, 2009 MANSFIELD -- Mansfield Mayor Curtis McCoy wants to start a pastor on patrol program for the Mansfield Police Department and he's selected as his first candidate a self-described minister with a controversial past that includes time spent on the other side of the jail bars and troubles with the court system. The Rev. Roy Jones' most recent job was a convenience store clerk for which he had to obtain an alcoholic beverage control card so that he could sell alcoholic beverages. \"This is something I'm trying to do to make a better relationship between the police and the citizens,\" McCoy said of Jones' appointment. Unlike a similar program run by the Shreveport Police Department where ministers volunteer their time to ride on patrol with officers, Mansfield's Pastor on Patrol won't depend upon volunteers - or at this point anyone beyond Jones. Jones will be paid $9 an hour and work 24 hours a week. Asked why he didn't use Shreveport's program as a model, McCoy answered, \"I don't know what Shreveport does nor do I care to know what Shreveport does on that line. I only know what Mansfield is doing. \"McCoy would not comment on Jones' checkered past or his ability to remain unbiased in situations involving the police and citizenry since he is on the city's payroll. \"Based on his relationship in the community as far as knowing people, every time I go to church, I see him in a pulpit - I'm serious. I'm talking the honest God truth. & If he's not pastoring, he's there as a guest. But he knows the people in the community, and I think over the years he has proven himself to be an asset. \"Part-time employees can work six months before being presented to the Board of Aldermen. That's why Jones' official appointment was news to two Mansfield aldermen. Mitch Lewis and G.B. \"Sonny\" Hall were unaware of Jones' addition to the payroll. Lewis admitted that he was questioned over the weekend about Jones being seen last week in a patrol car with a police officer. \"I talked to Roy today (at the council meeting),\" Lewis said Monday night. \"He said yes he was doing it, but he didn't go into it. He said he was pastor on patrol. He said he was trying to get involved with the youth on the weekend and stuff like, which I think is good, but & I don't know. I think (McCoy's) intentions were good to try to set up that type of program. \"Added Hall: \"Most true pastors volunteer their time to do that. \"Jones, who was unseated in October 2007 from his first term on the DeSoto Parish Police Jury, is a close friend of McCoy's. He's aided the mayor in his two election campaigns and frequently accompanies him to functions. Jones did not return a message left on his answering machine Monday. Jones grabbed his own headlines while on the parish governing body. He was consistently involved in employee issues and public criticism of the road department supervisor, including filing complaints with the state attorney general's office that were later deemed unfounded. The Mansfield resident got his own hand slapped in 2005 when the district attorney ordered him to reimburse the parish $175 for gravel he directed onto a private driveway. He has prior arrests for trespassing, issuing worthless checks, failure to appear in court for criminal neglect of family and for failing to report to court on issuing worthless check charges. While he spent time in the DeSoto Detention Center for his arrests, Jones has avoided jail sentences by paying off the insufficient funds and the late child support payments. McCoy said he would later evaluate the program and add a \"white minister, too, because we want everyone to have someone they can talk to.\" Jones is black.",

    "sentence": "Senate DFL proposes cuts, $2 billion tax hike. However, the DFL plan does not include $2 billion in federal economic stimulus money that lawmakers still do not know just how they can use. The Thursday announcement brought the first public acknowledgment that Democrats would increase taxes to help balance the budget. Senate Tax Chairman Tom Bakk, DFL-Cook, said a \"lion's share\" of the $2 billion in new revenue would come from higher taxes on the rich, apparently via the income tax. The plan calls for cutting every segment of state government, for a total of $2.4 billion. While the Democratic leaders say they would take roughly equal amounts of new taxes and program cuts to balance the budget, they have yet to figure out where to put about $2 billion in federal economic stimulus money. Given that, Senate Majority Leader Larry Pogemiller, DFL-Minneapolis, said education cuts may end up being moderated once details of how the state can spend the federal money are unraveled. The state's $33 billion two-year budget would be $6.4 billion short without cuts, new taxes and federal money. Pawlenty figures the federal money into his budget and calls the deficit $4.6 billion. He is to announce changes to his budget in the next week to 10 days, taking into account recent economic changes. Pawlenty's spokesman said it was good that DFL leaders \"are finally publicly admitting they'd like to wallop the families and small businesses of Minnesota with massive tax increases.\" Brian McClung added that the cuts did not look at funding priorities. \"An off-the-shelf computer program could do these kinds of across-the-board cuts,\" McClung said. \"We would expect more from DFL legislators.\" Tom Dooher, president of Education Minnesota, was not happy with the Senate announcement. \"The proposed cuts are not in the best interest of Minnesotaâ s school children,\" Dooher said. \"If enacted, they would seriously harm the quality of education the state takes pride in providing its students.\" House leaders plan to announce their budget outline soon, too. House and Senate committees will work out details of their budgets, then establish conference committees to work out differences between the two budgets. Pawlenty often has said he will veto tax increases, and Pogemiller has said that he believes Pawlenty. A third of the budget balancing act Democrats propose relies on higher taxes. Bakk said he would not allow his committee to consider adding the sales tax to clothing or services. Other taxes may be considered, he said, although higher taxes on the rich are his primary goal. Bakk also said he would like to freeze the amount of money the state gives local governments at a time when most policymakers are calling for a cut in local government aid. Pawlenty would cut the aid, which has raised city leaders' ire. Local governments will be forced to enact moderate property tax increases to deal with the DFL budget, Bakk said, but less than under Pawlenty's proposal. Republican senators said they were not consulted about the proposal. They called tax increases job killers, supporting Pawlenty's proposed business tax cuts instead. Pogemiller said drastic measures such as the 7 percent cut are needed because of the current recession. Most of the cuts, he added, will be to programs most affecting the state's needy residents. He called the economy \"as bad, potentially, as the 1930s.\" The Minnesota House unanimously voted to support freedom of the press Thursday, after a week of controversy. House Minority Leader Marty Seifert, R-Marshall â “ joined by House Majority Leader Tony Sertich, DFL-Chisholm â “ brought a motion to the floor voicing that support because proposed House rules would have restricted media work on the House floor and in committees. The proposed rules emerged a week ago today, creating a stir among the Capitol press corps. Then, Monday night, a committee page demanded to see credentials from a photographer â “ two hours after a House leadership spokesman assured the media that no credentials would be needed to cover committee meetings. Seifert said recent events had \"a chilling effect\" on the press. \"I am very concerned about what has taken place recently.\" Sertich said the proposed rules will not be implemented. He said there has been confusion as the rules were being discussed and no changes should have been made by House staff members. Rep. Torrey Westrom, R-Elbow Lake, said the talk of stricter press rules is a sign of bigger problems with DFL leaders. \"I know the press isn't really happy with some of the moves going on around here,\" Westrom said. \"I'm glad they are speaking up.\" Numerous House members have told reporters that they also were not happy with the proposals.",

    "sentence": "Local volunteers join flood fighting effort in Fargo. Tastefully Simple and The Alexandria Blizzard coordinated an effort to bus 300 volunteers from the Alexandria area to the affected area Tuesday. As the National Weather Service stuck to its prediction that the Red River will crest at 39 to 41 feet in Fargo-Moorhead on Friday, the mounting stress of a potential record flood began to take its toll. â Fear is setting in,â said Salvation Army Captain Adam Moore. â Weâ re seeing that on the streets. â As of 8:15 p.m. Monday, the Red River level in Fargo was 27.58 feet. Weather service officials warned that a storm system moving into the Red River Valley from Nebraska overnight could drop up to an inch of rain over a widespread area before the rain turns to snow Wednesday. Despite sporadic showers Monday, Fargo Mayor Dennis Walaker said the city â had a good day. â Fargo tried to speed up the dike-building process by deploying a portable wall system thatâ s used to protect soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan from bullets and grenades. Sharon Mueller watched from near her home just off 40th Avenue South as a payloader filled a wall of the Hesco containers with sand. Under the road, large ice chunks floated down the swollen Drain 27. Mueller, a retired bartender, said she couldnâ t believe how fast the rising water was running. She said that despite her husbandâ s complacency, she was worried about flooding. â Can you imagine what Noah must have felt like? â she said. Sandbagging hit high gear in the metro, as high schools let out students and colleges canceled classes to aid the effort. North Dakota Governor John Hoeven said students would be forgiven for missed school days. About 30 Concordia College students stacked sandbags around Barb Grothâ s house in Oakport Township north of Moorhead, where several hundred volunteers pitched in. Groth, whose home flooded in 1997 when the Red River crested at 39.57 feet, said she didnâ t think a repeat was possible. â I never thought it could happen again. Weâ re nervous,â she said. Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty stopped in Oakport and Moorhead, urging state residents to join the flood fight. About 230 Minnesota National Guard troops were helping with flood efforts, and he said he expects that number will eventually reach about 400. Hoeven said the stateâ s National Guard committed 500 soldiers to the water war, with more available. Fargo raised its goal for daily sandbag output to 300,000 to try to fill 2 million bags by Thursday. â If those neighborhoods hold, we are safe as a city,â said Fargo City Commissioner Tim Mahoney. â If weâ re unable to do that, weâ re going to have a problem. â The city was prepared for a Red River crest of 38 feet. Now, city officials want to get the dikes up to 42 feet, Mahoney said. At 41 feet â we lose a lot of houses,â he said. â If weâ re going to get this thing done, itâ s going to have to be done in the next 24 to 48 hours in a massive way. â The Fargodome, where volunteers waited for bus rides to Sandbag Central, the cityâ s utilities building, became its own sandbag-filling station with hundreds of shovel-wielding volunteers scooping sand dumped on the parking lot. Sandbaggers kept spirits up despite the gloomy weather and flood outlook. Fargo plans to give residents routes out of town Wednesday afternoon or Thursday, said Pat Zavoral, Fargo city administrator. â There are some locations in south Fargo where if the water does break away from these [dikes], they wonâ t be able to use Interstate-29,â he said. Fargo Police Chief Keith Ternes urged residents to go to the cityâ s Web site and register for the Code Red alert system so they can be reached in an emergency. Residents with land lines are already registered in the system. Sandbagging efforts continued overnight. City officials hope they get 300 people an hour to help fill sandbags at the cityâ s utility operation center at 2301 8th Ave. N. and 1,000 people an hour at the Fargodome. Hoeven asked for a presidential emergency declaration based on preparation efforts because of the costs. He said he thinks the state might get it today.",

    "sentence": "Meeting in Alexandria will discuss 2010 census. The town hall meetings, which will take place throughout spring and summer, will include a presentation on organizing local Complete Count Committees. Complete Count Committees are appointed by the mayor or other elected official and include leaders from the business, education, faith, media, non-profit, ethnic and other communities. These volunteer committees work together on community events such as festivals, parades, meetings and other activities to keep Minnesota first in the nation in responding to the census. The 2010 census is critical for Minnesota, which is at risk of losing one of its eight seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, according to census officials. Census information is also the foundation of equal representation in the state Legislature and determines the allocation of more than $300 billion in federal funding for everything from education to transportation. The business community also uses census information for planning, marketing, labor force projections and more. Additionally, the census will employ an estimated 8,000 Minnesotans throughout the process.",

    "sentence": "Roads in rough shape. â Itâ s not even traffic,â noted Douglas County Public Works Director Dave Robley. â Itâ s the freezing thatâ s the enemy. â Robley said that County Road 35, which is north of Alexandria near Lake Vermont, is closed because of water issues. He noted this is a seasonal issue that happens almost every year. In addition, water has caused a portion of County Road 56 to wash out. This road is located west of County Road 15, southwest of Brandon. Lastly, a culvert on County Road 96 is washed out, closing a portion of the road, which is located northeast of Kensington by Freeborn Lake. â Right now, these are the only three [county] roads that are closed,â said Robley. He asked that motorists use caution when driving around the county and if there is water flowing over the road, motorists should not drive on it. If there is standing water, he said proceed with caution. With Tuesdayâ s storm dumping even more snow on the area, Robley said public works will keep a close eye on area roads, but he said that depending on the conditions, he wasnâ t too concerned. Another road in pretty bad shape â “ probably the worst shape of any in the county, said Robley â “ is County Road 42. The road is scheduled for a major overhaul this spring, so for right now, the county is patching as needed to keep it together. â We are doing what we can to keep it safe,â said Robley. He noted the utility work for the project should start in April and the actual roadwork should begin shortly after that. He also mentioned there are plenty of other roads around the county with potholes or other problems that the public works department is working on, which he said is a normal occurrence this time of year. Robley added the roads may seem to be in worse shape this year because of the colder than normal temperatures. He reiterated that the amount of snow doesnâ t make as big of an impact as the cold temperatures. A wet fall helped drive the frost deeper, which wreaks havoc on roads. The county didnâ t use anymore salt or sand than it usually does, added Robley. Throughout the spring and summer months, the public works department will continue its maintenance of area roads â “ repairing, patching and crack sealing, as needed.",

    "sentence": "Grand Jury Indicts Man In December Slaying. When Alexandria police found the body of Juantissa Hill, 24, inside her Van Dorn Street apartment early last December, she had not shown up for work in two days. Her family, friends and coworkers waited for her missing Nissan Altima to turn up, hoping that it would lead police to the person who raped and killed the young Navy petty officer who worked at the Pentagon. Hill’s car was eventually found without a suspect inside, giving investigators only leads. On Monday, about three months later, an Alexandria grand jury indicted 31-year-old Rodney Eric Smith on charges of first-degree murder, forcible sodomy, robbery and grand larceny. As with the majority of rape and assault cases, Smith and Hill knew each other, according to Deputy Chief Blaine Corle, commander of police investigations. “This was not a stranger case,” Corle said. “We do know that they had some prior contact. We don’t have any reason to think that this was a case in which there was any danger to the public of a random assault.” Smith was arrested and convicted of “a relatively minor charge” in another state, according to Alexandria Commonwealth’s Attorney Randy Sengel, who will head Smith’s prosecution. Sengel would not identify the jurisdiction but said Smith was sentenced there and is currently incarcerated while awaiting a transfer to Virginia, where he will stand trial. Smith is also wanted in a third state for failure to appear in court in relation to other charges but will likely be sent to Virginia next under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers. “There is also another jurisdiction that has a warrant for him but we’ve been in touch with them and we’re going to try to coordinate [his transfer to Virginia],” Sengel said. “I think it’s fair to say that our case is by far the most serious of the cases and they won’t have any problem with us going ahead [with a trial].” Alexandria detectives worked with Naval Criminal Investigative Services in searching for Hill’s rapist and killer, utilizing military resources to investigate Hill’s background — her characteristics and associations — in hopes it would lead them to a suspect. “Any time you work a homicide investigation, getting to know a lot about your victim is often equal to where the case leads you,” Corle said. “And NCIS was very cooperative in helping us find out about Ms. Hill and … her background — who she associated with and things like that. All the things you just have to start digging from scratch on.” The leads police obtained in the case originated in Alexandria and the surrounding area, according to Corle. Police also received help from the public but “this just happens to be one of the cases where … the lion’s share of the success came from the work of the detectives in Alexandria,” Corle said. Police did not say exactly how they connected Smith with the homicide but Alexandria Police Spokeswoman Ashley Hildebrandt said the nature of his arrest and conviction in another state was “unrelated” to the type of crime inflicted on Hill. Sengel would not comment on whether it was related to sexual assault. Sengel estimated that Smith’s transfer to Virginia would take 60 to 90 days citing the suspect’s recent sentencing in the other jurisdiction and the copious amounts of paperwork necessary for an interstate transfer. Once here, he would go directly to trial in Alexandria’s Circuit Court, but given the circumstances and nature of the case, Sengel estimated that it could be a minimum of 90 days after he is transferred until Smith stands trial.",

The winning community will receive a $25,000 cash prize. The other finalists, Denver, Indianapolis, Louisville, Ky., New Haven, Conn., Sioux Falls, S.D. and Surprise, Ariz., were picked from an application pool that had towns with as few as 300 people or cities with as many as 700,000 inhabitants. Any city or town was eligible to take part in the contest. Alexandria was a finalist for the award in 2006 and 2007; Indianapolis, Louisville, New Haven and Sioux Falls are also repeat finalists in the competition this year. “The finalists are a very impressive group that are going far beyond the requirements of the law and are truly thinking outside the box to set new and inspiring examples of livable communities for all,” said AARP Livable Community Portfolio Director Brewster Thackeray. AARP sponsors the competition. The towns and cities selected as finalists had to show their efforts to include disabled people from all areas in everyday life, the NOD press release said.",

    "sentence": "School Board Hopefuls Square Off. It only took about five minutes before the persistent achievement gap in the Alexandria City Public Schools came to the forefront and the city’s school board election season began in earnest. The achievement gap — the gulf in graduation rates between white students and minority students in Alexandria, which the current ACPS board and senior staff has addressed several times over the last few months — was the central theme of the questions addressed during the Tenants and Workers United’s public forum Wednesday night at Cora Kelly Elementary School. The five District A school board candidates (Helen Morris, Mimi Carter, Bill Campbell, and incumbents Scott Newsham and Sheryl Gorsuch) answered each question in turn, some open-ended and others requiring a not-so-simple “yes” or “no.” While some of the candidates shared similarities in their approaches to cutting the achievement gap, each had their own take-home message. “The biggest way to make a dent [in the achievement gap] is on improving the engagement of everyone involved, especially families,” Campbell said. “The way to improve the engagement of families is through improving our communications … We need to go out and meet families and parents where they are.” Campbell went on to stress the importance of cultural competency and having the community firmly believe all students can achieve. Morris stressed the importance of coordinating the relationships inside and outside of school and that the school system needs to be willing to meet the community part of the way. “Education needs to be a partnership between parents, teachers and the children themselves, and if there is, and there’s a good roadmap, then our children will succeed,” Morris said. “It involves rigorous academics, community involvement in education and it involves character education.” Carter keyed in on accountability within ACPS and the need for a solid foundation from which to go about improving achievement among minorities and English language learners. “If we don’t have a system set up for our teachers to engage with our parents, the best communication system in the world will not work,” Carter said. “We really need to figure out how to set up these very basic things like translation services, bilingual staffing in the schools, start there and then set up a more systemized approach to engage parents.” Newsham, an incumbent, reiterated what he would continue to do as a school board representative, setting policy and obtaining the necessary resources for students to be successful, something that starts with the pending strategic plan and continues with high expectations in a rigorous curriculum. “I think the best way to close the achievement gap is to implement the strategic plan that the board has spent the last six to nine months developing,” Newsham said. “Within the school system over the last three years we have come to realize that there is an achievement gap, that it is a serious situation and that we have the means to address it.” As the other incumbent in District A, Gorsuch said that the board needs “to really analyze the data” on the achievement gap, discuss the issue, and look at the issue as early as preschool. “I think that the achievement gap happens before our students even hit school,” Gorsuch said. “Preschool is going to be an important part of our future discussions in the school system. “The predictor is there, we know that kids who don’t pass the third grade [Standards of Learning] test are generally the ones who don’t have preschool and that predicts a high probability of dropping out later.” TWU organized the forum as a venue for community members to get to know who the candidates are and come away with a better understanding of their thoughts on issues that most closely affect the black and Latino community in Alexandria. The Special Education Advisory Committee is holding the next scheduled public forum — for all candidates — on March 31 at Minnie Howard, with the time yet to be determined. On April 20, the Upper King Street Neighborhood Association is co-hosting a forum for District A candidates with the Inner City Civic Association and the Old Town Civic Association at the Durant Center (7:30 p.m.) The Departmental Progressive Club has organized its public forum for April 29 (7 p.m.). The Alexandria PTA Council will host three forums, one for each district: the District A forum is planned for April 22 at Mt. Vernon, District B on April 20 at Minnie Howard and District C on April 27 at Samuel Tucker. All of these forums are slated to begin at 7 p.m.",

    "sentence": "'Free' Money Headed to Alexandria. It’s not as simple a concept as the traditional Santa Claus delivering presents to a struggling family at Christmas, but the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, better known as the federal stimulus package, has City Hall creating a wish list for the money’s allocation. And the complexity of the funding has the city checking that list over and over and over again. The proposed list, comprised of needs from city departments, once consisted of hundreds of projects worth over $600 million on which the city hoped to capitalize. Officials did not expect to receive that vast amount of funding, but dubbed it part of their vetting process to allocate the money. Since President Barack Obama signed the Act, that list has been narrowed down to about 25 to 30 projects, according to Mayor Bill Euille. But receiving stimulus money and implementing it in the city’s best interest seems to be consumed by the dense bureaucracy of federal lawmaking and the fluid nature of the stimulus package itself. Some money will also go through the state to be allocated by Governor Tim Kaine. “Everything is changing on the dime, hour by hour, day by day,” Euille said, a day after spending four hours on the Hill with other mayors and Congressional delegations. Officials would not prioritize the various projects they hope to achieve, but have set up an intergovernmental system to monitor the myriad stipulations and rules crowding around the free money. Essentially, it is a task force that will make sure projects fundable by the Act won’t fall through the cracks while making sure projects that qualify meet the necessary criteria. The City Council will have ultimate say, according to a memo that places the body at the top of the chain, and although the city has its own priorities, they do not always parallel the funding available from the stimulus package. The city will have to prioritize according to other factors as well, like speed. “Expediency will be important, and those projects that are ‘shovel ready’ will be more likely to receive federal funding,” stated City Manager Jim Hartmann in a memo to the mayor and City Council that reflected a briefing from Congressman Jim Moran (D – 8). “Certainly we have some potential to do things that were not otherwise on the priority list but are important long-range projects,” City Manager Jim Hartmann said. “Much of the energy efficiency items —they have a long term payback for the city. So frankly we welcome those things.” The most recent published wish list (which consists of much more than 30 projects), contains everything from restructuring the city marina to repaving Interstate 395 to helping victims of the recession. Among 12 other committees in the workflow, the implementation committee has the job of obtaining the actual grant funding for such projects as well as clearing any hurdles to obtaining funding. “The implementation committee is going to look for, primarily, barriers to implementation,” Hartmann said. “If we have a priority project [we will] move it as fast as we can while being mindful of the rules and regulations that we have in the city.” Money from the stimulus package was not accounted for in the city’s current proposed budget, so some of the money could supplant or offset budget gaps, even if the city cannot use them as part of the budget, perhaps having to utilize itemized grants based on the stimulus plan’s stipulations. “The devil’s going to be in the details,” Hartmann said. “Whether certain stimulus spending might be seen as supplanting the budget depends on if it’s allowed or not. If there are things in the budget where we could use stimulus funds instead of using city funds that could be used for other critical areas, certainly those will be considered. “It’s hard to calculate what that net benefit may be. I think there will be a smaller portion of offsetting things within the budget, but it will be able to help us accomplish other goals that maybe were not funded in this budget.” Citing the fluid nature of the process and the numerous departments in line and in need for funding, officials would not prioritize one project over another. But Hartmann gave the “classic” example of Polk School Gymnasium, a “shovel ready” project that has already been designed and is awaiting funding to be realized. Still, it is not yet certain if the project has a money pot available. “I don’t have the authority to say this project is going to go ahead of that project,” Euille said. “It’s going to be a total collaboration because we have every department and agency involved.” There is no distinct timeline on when final decisions will occur; it will take more time for the bill’s contents to take a tangible shape and the city will be doing more evaluations and setting priorities “I think the next two months are going to be very instrumental on what we’re going to be doing,” Hartmann said.",

    "sentence": "New School to Open in Old Town . This fall, the classical education is coming back to Alexandria, but almost half a year and several large hurdles remain before the school can officially open its doors. The move to establish the Washington Latin School, led by T.R. Ahlstrom and Headmaster Tom Soule, is gearing up for the start to its academic calendar on September 8 at a location yet to be determined in Old Town. The school hopes to attract students with a rigorous, classics-based curriculum and a significantly reduced tuition, due to the current economy. Students enrolling for the school’s first year will pay an annual tuition of $14,000, plus other fees, during the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 school years, roughly $10,000 less than the original sticker price. Once the school’s financial base is strong enough, Ahlstrom and Soule plan to admit students on a partial- or full-scholarship basis — the founders are aware that the $24,000 average price tag is not possible for everyone — making it financially viable for students from lower-income backgrounds to attend. “My take on this, and T.R. and I have talked about this before, is ‘classics for everyone,’” Soule said. “Far too often that kind of education isn’t available to people of all socio-economic backgrounds.” Ahlstrom said that the results found at the Washington Latin Public Charter School in Washington, D.C., one of two public Latin schools that he has helped found in the last seven years — Bronx Latin in New York City is the other — prove that people of all economic backgrounds can thrive in the demanding, classical setting. Currently, there are three locations in Old Town being looked at as the school’s initial home, Soule and Ahlstrom said. The educational philosophy at the Washington Latin School in Alexandria is somewhat similar to Ahlstrom’s previous two endeavors, but is setting out as an independent, privately funded school rather than one receiving public funds. “This is my third school in the last seven years,” Ahlstrom said. “The other projects were very successful, and we believe this one will be more successful because we’ve chosen not to do it as a public school, but as an independent, co-educational classical school. “I’m not trying to be a basher of public schools, I’m a product of them. The fact of the matter is that there is one kind of school in this country for prosperous people and another kind of education for everyone else.” Both Ahlstrom and Soule worked at the Washington Latin School Charter School before leaving in late 2007 to start the independent school venture. Soule said that by then, they “had reached a ceiling” with what they were able to do educationally at the charter school and wanted to move on to a new situation that would allow for more independence. According to Soule and Charter School Board meeting minutes, the D.C. Charter School Board disagreed with Ahlstrom’s proposal to move the school from Northwest D.C. to Penn Quarter and ultimately nixed the idea. The charter school’s current headmaster, Martha Cutts, came on after Ahlstrom and Soule left, but said that in the time since the school has continued to flourish, swelling to 341 students this year from 179 only two years before. In 2008, the school opened a second campus in D.C. for its eighth and ninth graders, and applications for the upcoming school year are up 74 percent, Cutts said. While it appears the charter school is established and growing, the Washington Latin School in Alexandria has its own set of hurdles to clear. Getting students and their families to move away from their current schools could be considered one of the project’s biggest obstacles, but Ahlstrom and Soule are confident that the niche they’re trying to fill with the Washington Latin School is one that will not struggle to attract students. “There’s no problem getting kids and families to commit,” Ahlstrom said. “Every school we’ve ever done, there’s a long line at the door. There will be here, too. The real challenge is funding without getting public money.” Donna Molinari of Alexandria Country Day School said that the Latin School is starting in much the same way that ACDS did in the 1980s, and that based on the differences in curriculum the new school probably would not affect its enrollment too much. “I think they have their reputation behind them to help propel them forward, and it’s a curriculum that’s been around for a while, and that will help them,” Molinari said. “Of course, the hurdles are those that all new schools face, and are affected even more so in a tough economic climate.” During a March 17 public meeting at Charles Beatley Library, Ahlstrom dove into some of the financing they’re looking for with the new school. Aside from tuition for the students enrolling in the first year — fifth grade, sixth grade and seventh grade only — the school is looking for 10 “founding families,” each of whom would pay $100,000 in the first year, covering the child’s tuition through graduation. In addition, the school is looking for 12 individuals or corporations to contribute $200,000 each over the next five years in order to solidify the school’s financial base. “Is it hard work? Yes. Is it more difficult because of this economy? Of course,” Ahlstrom said. “We’ve asked the question, ‘How can we turn this negative economy in a positive thing?’ And I think we’ve done that.” The plan is to add a new higher and lower grade each year, but for the first year the school is hoping to draw about 50 students, enough for a single cohort of fifth, sixth and seventh grade students. Alexandria City Public Schools, experiencing its own enrollment increase, are not expecting the new school to affect what they do to any great extent, but are eager to see what comes about, Director of Communications Amy Carlini said. “We’ll have to wait and see how it works out,” Carlini said. “It’s going to be interesting to see what happens.”",

    "sentence": "Standing by Sudan. As unfavorable ideas go, this one is a corker, as far as Egypt is concerned. The choices that confront Sudan preoccupy Egypt. One danger, for both Egypt and Sudan, lies in failing to think clearly about short term and long term. In the short term, peace in Darfur is a priority for both Egypt and Sudan. In the long term, Sudan's territorial integrity and national sovereignty are at stake. \"Egypt seeks peace and we don't have a hidden agenda,\" President Hosni Mubarak declared. Egypt proposed a United Nations conference to discuss the ICC indictment of Bashir, even though the Sudanese government declined Cairo's bid on the pretext that it might lead to the internationalisation of the issue. Southern Sudan is rich in economic resources, which attracts Western and Asian, especially Chinese, interests out to make a quick kill. With this in mind, Egypt understands the gravity of the threat that faces Sudan. Peacekeepers have a deplorable record in Sub-Saharan Africa. Their failure to protect civilians from ill-disciplined government troops and pro-government militias is proverbial. In Sudan the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) has so far kept a relatively low profile. Some 1,500 Egyptian troops are currently stationed in Darfur, even though certain Darfur armed opposition groups objected to the Egyptian participation in UNAMID, most notably the Justice and Equality Movement and the Sudan Liberation Army. Egypt was one of the first countries to send its UNAMID contingency to Darfur. In the turbulent aftermath of the ICC indictment of Sudanese President Al-Bashir the future of the hitherto buoyant Sudanese economy may be in jeopardy. \"This is the last thing Egypt wants. Egypt would like to see a prosperous, politically stable and peaceful Sudan,\" El-Feki explained. \"Egypt is poised for participating positively in Sudan's economic uplift.\" \"As far as Egypt is concerned, the indictment of President Al-Bashir by the ICC would have a detrimental impact on the Sudanese economy. That is neither in the interest of Sudan nor Egypt,\" El-Feki added. The cost to Sudan of withholding aid might be high at a time of global penny- pinching. But the consequences of inaction will be far higher. It is against this backdrop that Egypt is prepared to help Sudan in any fashion the Sudanese people require. Sudan is bracing itself for a big bang and a perfect storm. The country stands at the crossroads. This is a testing time for the current and future administrations of Sudan, and Egyptian officials are acutely conscious of the Sudanese conundrum and are at pains to explain that they would back whatever decisions the Sudanese people adopt. If push comes to shove, managing a potentially tricky Sudanese transition will not be easy. Moreover, it would be a protracted affair and may prove awkward for both Egypt and Sudan. For all these reasons, Egypt assumes its responsibilities to drive forward this necessary new Sudan. Tacit agreement to do nothing would be dangerous for both neighbours. There are other reasons for caution. The need for dialogue between all the rival Sudanese factions is pivotal. \"It is for this reason that Egypt attempts to maintain close contacts with all the various political groups, both government and opposition,\" El-Feki stressed. \"At the same time we should work on initiatives to drive forward a more productive, more democratic Sudan,\" he concluded. Egypt may not have much leverage over Sudan, but a rift in bilateral relations between Egypt and its neighbour to its immediate south will be detrimental to both countries. The balkanisation of Sudan will come at a time when Egypt can least afford it. \"But this is a question for the Sudanese people to determine.\" \"We are only concerned about Sudan's interests and the welfare of its people,\" Mubarak stated categorically. He dispatched Foreign Minister Ahmed Abul- Gheit and General Intelligence Chief Omar Suleiman to the Sudanese capital Khartoum to discuss the latest crisis concerning the International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant for President Omar Al-Bashir. Egyptian officials concur that the primary purpose of Egypt's solidarity with Sudan is to advance the interests of the \"two fraternal neighbouring states,\" as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee of the People's Assembly Mustafa El-Feki told . \"Sudan constitutes the strategic depth of Egypt and is key to its water security and potentially for its food security too. Sudan's agricultural potential is tremendous and yet untapped. Egypt is prepared to step up its agricultural investment in Sudan. And, we are prepared to work with representatives of all the various Sudanese groups and regions. If the southern Sudanese people decide to secede, we are ready to accept and respect their choice. If they decide to stay within a federal Sudan, we will back them. Among numerous joint ventures, we have established a branch of the University of Alexandria in the southern Sudanese capital of Darfur.\"",

    "sentence": "Godless in Godapitiya. One prediction about Sri Lankan political developments in 2009 that can be made with absolute confidence is that wanton terrorist acts of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ealam (LTTE) will not diminish. This is partly because the have-nots and in particular disgruntled elements of the ethnic Tamil minority have many grievances. Talk about incorporating the Tamil community more in the decision-making process of the island- nation nonetheless continue and the former deputy leader of the LTTE Vinyagamoorthi Muralitharan has been appointed non- cabinet minister for natural integration and reconciliation. Many Tamil separatists have come round to accept that unless they start at least to talk about their own eventual disarmament and incorporation into the Sri Lankan political establishment, they will find it extremely hard to get many of the ethnic Sinhalese majority on their side. However, many Sri Lanka analysts believe that peace is just a pipe dream. If the Tamil moderates show no sign of living up to this side of the bargain, the Sinhalese majority's resentment will multiply and will become less and less willing to agree to further power-sharing schemes. There was a time when many influential Tamils had opted for independence. Centuries of progroms and panics taught Tamils that the Sinhalese leaders always have a better hand than their own Tamil leaders. But here is a paradox. There are important segments of the Tamil community with a vested interest in preserving the unity and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka. However wonderful in theory it is to remove the Tamil Tigers' threat once and for all, incidents such as the unfortunate terrorist attack on Tuesday denote the notion of relegating the LTTE to the sidelines like so much pie in the sky. The hard-headed practitioners of realpolitik like Sri Lanka's former president Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga will not for the moment be joining the fray. Oddly enough what will drive the incessant talk about elevating the status of the Tamil people of Sri Lanka are the hardliners of the ruling party. Nobody in the Sri Lankan political establishment is certain that the LTTE will honour a later promise to disarm. Divisions in the ruling United People's Congress of Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse do not inhibit the government's resolve to end the LTTE uprising. The Sri Lankan civil war, which erupted in 1972 when LTTE took up arms against the government, has so far claimed the lives of some 70,000 people. When historians look back on his presidency, they may well judge him most on whether he managed to quell the Tamil uprising. According to the pro-LTTE Tamilnet website, 75 civilians were killed last week as a result of Sri Lankan government army shelling of LTTE-administered areas of the island. It is estimated that around 200,000 civilians were trapped in the war zone in the northern parts of the country. The Sri Lankan government accuses the LTTE of using the civilian Tamil population as human shields, but by all accounts, the LTTE appears to be losing the battles on the ground and resorting in desperation instead to its timeworn tradition of terrorism. Tamil separatists can be said to have invented suicide bombing and hold the record, a most sorry one. The participation of senior government officials in a Muslim festival was a show of sectarian solidarity, which renders the attack all the more poignant. The suicide bombing occurred in the town of Akuressa, in Matara district some 160km south of the Sri Lankan capital Colombo. The Sri Lankan government is now taking stock and looking at how these figures are adding up. Hopes are high that things will get better. The Sinhalese political establishment will have to re-sell what contemporary Sri Lanka stands for. They will be tested by the Tamils' terrorist acts. Ambassador Ansar explained that the bombing was supposed to cause maximum damage and loss of life. Sri Lanka has a Muslim population of more than two million, geographically concentrated in the eastern part of the country. They have generally been neutral in the war between Tamils and Sinhalese, refusing to take sides. The leader of the Tamil separatists Veluppillai Prabhakaran is still at large and sporadic armed conflict in the north of the island is expected to continue unabated even though the observers anticipate an escalation of terrorist attacks throughout the island nation and perhaps even against Sri Lankan interests overseas. Ambassador Ansar, a Sri Lankan Muslim himself, noted that peace will inevitably be a long, drawn out process. \"We will need all the support we can muster from our allies overseas. The international community must extend its cooperation in face of terrorism and we must fight together.\" Yes, it has been a traumatic week for Sri Lanka. Some 14 people were killed and scores were injured, including Sri Lanka's Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Mahinda Wijesekara, as they joined thousands of pilgrims to the holy shrine at the historic mosque at Godapitiya. No less than six ministers took part in the celebratory procession marking \"This is a barbaric attack on innocent civilians. The LTTE had suffered a series of military setbacks in the past year and has been cornered in the northeastern part of the island.",

    "sentence": "Slight sigh of relief. Ahli can sleep a bit more comfortably after Petrojet beat Ismaili on Monday 1-0. The win stymied Ismaili's attempt to catch Ahli, the defending champions, who remain atop the leader board with 42 points after 21 games. Enppi and Petrojet are tied with 39 points and 22 games played. Ismaili drop to fourth on 38 points after 21 games. Observers say Ahli are lucky to still be in the lead after collecting just three points from their last four matches. Ismaili, who seeks to win their first league title since 2002, had blown the title race wide open with a 1-0 victory over a depleted Ahli side at Cairo Stadium. That was followed by a 0-0 draw in which 10-man Ahli failed to find their way through Police Union's tight defence. They also could not avenge their 1-0 defeat to Talaat Youssef's side in the first half of the season. Ahli's mercurial midfielder Mohamed Barakat was sent off in the second half for picking up two yellow cards, one for simulation in the penalty area and another for a clumsy tackle on a Police defender. Palestinian keeper Ramzi Saleh made his third successive start, replacing the error-prone Amir Abdul-Hamid and did admirably in keeping his net clean. Ahli coach Manuel Jose made two substitutions during the second half in a bid to improve his side's attack. Strikers Hani El-Egeizi and Ahmed Belal were introduced to play alongside Flavio but the pair, who do not play regularly, were obviously not fit. Jose's plans suffered another blow after Barakat received his marching orders six minutes past the hour mark for lunging at an opponent. The Portuguese tactician was forced to substitute Angolan hitman Flavio with right-back Ahmed Sedik. Ahli kept pushing forward despite their numerical disadvantage but failed to carve out any clear-cut chances. Police held firm to secure a share of the spoils with the defending champions. Police Union moved to ninth place on 27 points, seven clear of the relegation zone. Ahli assistant coach Hossam El-Badri refused to blame referee Gehad Greisha for his side's goalless draw. \"I can't say that the referee cost us a win. He did not make any profound mistakes,\" El-Badri stated. \"Our players played well but were unlucky in the first half and matters went from bad to worse when Barakat was sent off. \"The competition will be fierce in the upcoming games, but I don't want Ahli supporters to be worried because we are determined to keep our title.\" Indeed, Ismaili's loss to Petrojet did go quite a ways to Ahli capturing their fifth straight league crown. Police assistant coach Mohamed Ibrahim lauded his team's defence that put Ahli strikers at bay throughout the match. \"We were aware that Ahli will keep pushing forward during the whole game,\" Ibrahim said. \"Credit our defenders for successfully marking Ahli. We succeeded in achieving our target of avoiding a defeat.\" Elsewhere, no sooner had Zamalek ended a six-game run without a win by beating Enppi 1-0 than they failed to build on their win by losing 2-1 to Haras Al-Hedoud and equal their worst record of nine Egyptian Premier League defeats in one season. Egyptian Cup winners Haras Al-Hedoud, who will play in next season's CAF Confederation Cup, moved into fourth place on 36 points as they continued their impressive form under manager Tarek El-Ashri. Al-Hedoud managed to break the deadlock after just five minutes. Ahmed Abdel-Ghani curled a superb free- kick over the wall and into the corner of the net past the hapless Abdel-Wahed Al-Sayed. Zamalek defender Amr El-Safti thought he had equalised shortly afterwards after Al-Hedoud keeper Mathurin Kameni spilled a tame cross into his path, but his goal was ruled offside. Zamalek still had better possession but rarely threatened Kameni as the efficient Al-Hedoud doubled their advantage on 27 minutes. Talented midfielder Abdel-Salam Nagah whipped in a pinpoint cross from the right and Abdel-Hamid Bassiouni rose above the static Amr Adel to head home. Sherif Ashraf, who came on as a second-half substitute, pulled one back with 13 minutes remaining but the hosts held onto their lead to claim all three points. Despite their defeat, Zamalek assistant coach Sami El-Sheshini was pleased with his side's performance. \"We are gradually improving. We played a very good game tonight, especially in the second half,\" El-Sheshini told reporters after the match. \"I just want Zamalek fans to be patient. The players produced promising displays and I'm sure the results will be better in the upcoming matches,\" El-Sheshini added. After the loss to Al-Hedoud, Zamalek lie ninth in the league table on 27 points, seven above the relegation zone. In other matches, Enppi remained in the title race with a 1-0 victory over Egypt Telecom, failing to end a 12-match winless streak in manager Hossam Hassan's debut. Al-Gaish produced an impressive display to beat Ittihad 4-1 on Saturday. The big win lifts Al-Gaish to eighth in the table with 29 points. Ittihad remain sixth, one point ahead of Farouk Gaafar's men. Ernest Papa Arku broke the deadlock for Gaish on 33 minutes, before a brace from Salah Amin (63, 81) and a 90th minute strike by Yassine Abdul-Aal sealed the win. Mohamed Ragab scored Ittihad's consolation in the 83rd minute. In Port Said, Tersana showed determination to remain in the first division by beating Misri 2-0. Ismaili were handed a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Esperance in the Arab Champions League (ACL) quarter-final first leg played in Tunisia last week. Mickael Eneramo broke the deadlock on 27 minutes before Oussama Darragi doubled Esperance's lead in the second half while Mohab Said scored a vital away goal for Ismaili 12 minutes from time. The home side opened the scoreline when Abdel-Hamid Sami brought down Michael Eneramo in the box. The Nigerian successfully sent Mohamed Sobhi the wrong way. As the Egyptian club tried to push for an equaliser, they were exposed at the back and Esperance looked closer to adding a second. Early in the second half, Eneramo was once again allowed to go one on one with Sobhi but the 28-year-old net minder did well to keep the shot out. In the 73rd minute, Darragi added his team's second by capitalising on some poor defending from Ismaili to slot home past the helpless Sobhi. Ismaili were brought back to life when Abdullah Saied's cross found Said unguarded on the far post, the midfielder easily heading past Kasraoui. The two teams will clash again in the tie's second leg in a week's time in Ismailia.",

    "sentence": "Rethinking Egypt-US relations. Since Obama took office, hopes for better times spread over the Middle East. Egypt, which often had trouble communicating with the administration of George Bush Jr, is now hoping for improved bilateral ties. At least since the 1970s, three main themes dominated Egyptian-US relations: the peace process, the situation in the Gulf, and financial assistance. These themes may offer us some guidance as to how the future will look. Egyptian-US partnership regarding the peace process started in earnest with Jimmy Carter, who sponsored the Camp David Accords and the subsequent Egyptian- Israeli Peace Treaty. The sense of mutual commitment to peace survived throughout the administration of George Bush Sr and his secretary of state James Baker, culminating in the Madrid Conference for peace in the Middle East in 1991, the international gathering that endorsed the \"land-for-peace\" formula. The second theme of cooperation was Gulf security. During Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Egypt was instrumental in forming the international coalition to roll back the invasion. The third theme was US assistance to Egypt which, despite what its detractors may say, has helped rebuild Egypt's infrastructure for the past few decades. During the 1990s, economic assistance began to be phased out. And certain efforts were made through the Mubarak-Gore partnership to create a free trade zone as an option to help the Egyptian economy. But the Clinton and Bush Jr administrations didn't pursue that option in earnest. Cooperation on all three of these issues diminished during the presidency of George Bush Jr. The Palestinian problem, in particular, suffered as a result. The Bush administration started out by blaming the Clinton administration for involving the US too greatly in the Arab-Israeli conflict. US indifference concerning the Palestinian problem continued until the Bush administration finally admitted that something needed to be done. Subsequently, the administration said that it favoured a two-state solution. US rhetoric, however, was not matched by action. On the contrary, the Bush Jr administration undermined the concept of a geographically-connected Palestinian state when, during a visit by Israel's prime minister to the US in July 2004, it said that Israel may hold on to major settlements in the West Bank and Jerusalem. And for all the visits by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to the region, the Bush administration failed to come up with cohesive policy on the Palestinian issue and largely ignored the question of settlements. It was only recently, and timidly, that Rice admitted during her last visit to the region that the building of settlements was not helping the cause of peace. As for cooperation over Gulf security, this cooperation receded when the Bush administration ignored the warnings and advice of Egypt and invaded Iraq. The invasion, as we know now, sowed only turmoil in the region. It damaged the US's image, increased terror, and turned Iran into a key regional power. Another thing that marred Egyptian relations with the previous US administration was the latter's misguided ideas on democratisation. American arguments were often viewed in Egypt, even by civil society organisations, as interference in Egyptian internal affairs. This brief survey of Egyptian-US relations shows that Egypt cooperated closely with Washington at times when US policies were positive, as in the times of Carter and George Bush Sr. But tensions were unavoidable during the time of Bush Jr. Much now hinges on the US taking a fresh view of the Arab- Israeli conflict, one that casts away the conventional bias towards Israel that has so far undermined the quest for an acceptable solution. Much depends also on what the Obama administration does about extracting itself from the Iraq morass, restoring peace and stability there and the Gulf, and handling the Iranian nuclear issue. This analysis may seem to suggest that responsibility for moving forward on Egyptian-US relations rests solely with the US. Of course, this cannot be true. Egypt, for its part, needs to build its credibility in the region. If anything, this would persuade the Americans that Egypt is a country one should listen to, even when one doesn't totally agree with what it says. Egypt needs also to embrace democracy, revitalise its economy, stamp out corruption, and pursue an enlightened cultural course. Former US ambassador to Egypt Dan Kurtzer recommended in a recent paper that Washington and Cairo should realise the importance of their bilateral relations and listen carefully to what each other has to say. I cannot agree more.",

    "sentence": "What policy? . Apart from Shimon Peres giving Hillary Clinton a kiss on the cheek, nothing much emerged from the first visit to the Middle East of the new US secretary of state. We have no indication of where the policies of the Obama administration are heading. Actually, it seems so far that there is no tangible change from the policies of the former administration. During her visit to Israel, Clinton spoke in favour of the two-state solution but said she has no intention of talking to Hamas. Clinton had nothing to say about the need for Israel to stop building settlements all over Palestinian land. Nor did she have anything to say about the Gaza tragedy. She didn't mention the need to open the crossings and follow up on the efforts Egypt is making to bring about a calming down period. And yet Clinton made a point of empathising with Israel with regards to Palestinian rockets. And she fully understood Israel's concern over the prospects of Iran developing nuclear weapons. Clinton kept her options open concerning future talks with Syria and Iran. Washington seems prepared to engage the Syrians in dialogue if this helps Damascus distance itself from Tehran. And the Syrians seem willing to go to any lengths to stay on Washington's good side. It seems that the US wants to see moderate Arabs and Palestinians negotiating with Israel, although actually the Palestinians have been doing just that for quite some time now to no avail. Israel expressed strong reservations about any negotiations with Tehran, and obtained a promise that Washington wouldn't formulate its policy regarding the Iranian nuclear question without consulting with Israeli officials first. And it seems that Clinton bought Livni's claim that moderate Arab countries are more concerned about Iran than Israel. Some Arab countries were ecstatic that Clinton's first visit to the region started in Sharm El-Sheikh, where she attended a conference for the reconstruction of Gaza. I don't know how relevant this is to anything. What I know is that Arab countries have failed to ask for anything specific. They have failed to come up with a cohesive view and to relay it to the Americans. At present, the Arabs have no policy for dealing with an Israeli right-wing government led by Netanyahu. The designated prime minister has never showed any interest in peace, aside from what he sees as \"economic peace\"; namely, any arrangement that allows Israel to exploit the resources of the region at will. It may be too early to speculate on the future of the region as Washington sees it. But by the look of things it seems that Washington is hoping that the region will turn against Tehran and all radical groups affiliated with it. But what's in it for us? Hostility to Iran can only benefit Israel and divide the Arab world. It would be a continuation of the same circumstances that led to the tragedy in Gaza. Clinton came to the region with Iran on her mind. The main issue -- namely, the Arab-Israeli conflict -- is not being addressed for now. And it is unlikely to be broached before a new Israeli government is formed. I know some people are hoping to see Clinton give her backing to Egyptian efforts for a calming-down period in Palestine and for inter-Palestinian reconciliation. But I find it worrisome that we still have no idea how the Obama administration might react to someone like Lieberman becoming Israel's next foreign minister. The man is a racist who insulted the Egyptian president, threatened to bomb the High Dam, and described the Palestinians as insects. How will Washington deal with such a man? More importantly, how will Cairo deal with such a man?",

Twin sisters Lindsay and Charlotte Graham, students at St. John's Lutheran School in Lombard, won first- and second-place awards respectively in the annual Sheldon Peck letter-writing contest. Each year Lombard fifth-graders pretend to be Sheldon Peck, an early Lombard settler and portrait artist, writing to Abraham Lincoln in 1848. This year more than 40 handwritten letters were judged on historical accuracy, letter-writing skills and student research on pioneer life in Babcock Grove (now Lombard). The awards were given Sunday at Sheldon Peck Homestead in Lombard. Lindsay received $40 with her first-place certificate and Charlotte received $25. The third-place certificate and $10 was given to Amanda Chlebek, a fifth-grader at Pleasant Lane School. The winning letters will be featured in a Lombard Historical Society newsletter and Lombard's TV Cable 6. Roselle police ticketed hundreds of motorists last month as part of a traffic crackdown partially funded with state grant money. Police said they issued 584 citations for speeding in February. They also made 13 DUI arrests and wrote 63 tickets for failure to wear a seat belt. Another 115 citations were issued for other violations. The grant money Roselle police received from Illinois Department of Transportation covered the cost of overtime for speed enforcement. Roselle officers this month are continuing the speed enforcement efforts. DuPage Sheriff John Zaruba is warning residents about two recent scams that his deputies are investigating. In one case, a resident who lives near Bensenville lost an undisclosed amount of money when they followed a caller's instructions to wire money to Canada for a family member's bond. The resident assumed the caller was truthful since the family member was named but, later, the resident learned that relative had never been arrested and was not even in Canada. In the second scam, a resident who lives near Glen Ellyn reported a telephone scam in which a caller requested the victim send money to cover processing fees for his Canadian Lottery winnings. The victim became suspicious and, instead of sending the money, alerted authorities.",

    "sentence": "Stores a sign of better times in Schaumburg? . Could new Whole Foods and Crate & Barrel stores in Schaumburg be the first green shoots to spring up from the economy's winter-frozen soil? Schaumburg trustees Tuesday approved a site plan for a 34,000-square-foot Crate & Barrel store at the intersection of Woodfield and Martingale roads. It joins an already approved 65,000-square-foot Whole Foods on the former site of the John M. Smyth Homemakers building razed last summer. Community Development Director Christopher Huff said the Whole Foods is expected to begin above-ground construction this spring, with the Crate & Barrel next door to begin shortly after. Both are expected to open in the late spring or early summer of 2010. Though both projects have been in the pipeline for a few years, their going forward at this point is seen as a very significant step. \"To me, it's the first sign of a recovery of some sort, because they didn't pull the plug on them,\" Huff said. The twin projects' importance is not lost on the village department whose task it is to track economic growth - or its relative absence recently. \"It's a pretty big deal because we're down about two-thirds from what we were at a year and a few months ago,\" Huff said. \"We're happy to see any new development,\" Senior Planner Tom Farace agreed. As actions speak louder than words, the two companies are demonstrating a belief in the bright future of their location just south of Woodfield Shopping Center and west of the Streets of Woodfield, Huff said. Elected officials also saw a ray of sunshine in the projects. \"I think they see the same light at the end of the tunnel that I do,\" Mayor Al Larson said of the renewed show of confidence from these two businesses. Corporate officials for Northbrook-based Crate & Barrel couldn't be reached for comment Tuesday. But last summer they said they've had a policy of moving their houseware stores from malls to larger, separate lots in order to sell furniture as well. The company has had a store at Woodfield since 1979.",

A federal grand jury in Milwaukee has returned a three-count indictment against a Chicago couple accused of posing as destitute Kenyan refugees and scamming Carmelite nuns in Pewaukee out of more than $800,000. Acting U.S. Attorney Michelle Jacobs announced the indictment Tuesday charging 35-year-old Angela Martin-Mulu and 39-year-old Edward Bosire with mail fraud. The two Kenyan citizens arrived in the U.S. in 1999 and received political asylum in 2007. The indictment said the two targeted religious orders by claiming they suffered from illnesses and needed money for medical bills or education, at the same time maintaining apartments in Chicago and Bolingbrook, Ill., and spending much of the money at casinos or on things unrelated to medical or educational expenses. An FBI affidavit has said the married couple first visited the Pewaukee monastery in December 2004 and told the nuns they were brother and sister, homeless and would be killed if they were deported to Kenya. Prosecutors said the nuns gave them cash and checks over a three-year period, totaling about $815,000 before the scheme was discovered. Sister Mary Agnes has said the money came from the nuns' health fund, and she declined to say how much of the fund had been depleted. She said the nuns don't have health insurance because it's too expensive.",

The fire doors also weren't working, but he says it isn't unusual for both items to be temporarily out of commission when a building is undergoing a renovation like the $50 million project at the Empress. The casino itself wasn't heavily damaged, and the fire sparked by a construction worker was contained to the pavilion area.

    "sentence": "Pool operators look to prevent another crypto outbreak. Last summer, a crypto outbreak scared plenty of people away from public pools and water parks across North Texas. \"No system will completely take crypto out of a pool,\" said Chris Swartz, NRH{-2}O manager. \"But this is state-of-the-art in recreational water management.\" The ultraviolet disinfection system is among the approaches cities and private water park operators are taking to address what has become a serious problem. Last year, 476 cases of crypto were reported throughout Tarrant County. In July, crypto was discovered in the water of Burger’s Lake in west Fort Worth; a swimmer was identified as the source of the infection. Throughout the summer, cases of crypto were reported and linked to various public pools. Crypto cases are on the rise in Texas and nationwide and health officials aren’t sure why. Last year in Texas there were 1,981 confirmed cases, up from 233 in 2007, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. The increase might be due to heightened awareness of the parasite and increased reporting, said Michele Hlavsa, an epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"Instead of thinking 'Where did I eat?’ people are thinking 'Where did I swim?’ \" she said. What makes crypto so difficult to deal with is its resistance to normal levels of chlorine and ability to survive more than 10 days in water. Many area cities plan to hyperchlorinate, or shock, pool water using high amounts of chorine. While that is an effective way to treat crypto, it cannot prevent an outbreak. The best thing people can do is avoid swimming if they have been sick, said David Jefferson, environmental health manager for Tarrant County Public Health. \"What people have to remember is when you are in a swimming pool, you are in other people’s bodily fluids,\" he said. Even an ultraviolet system has limitations. The devices work by interfering with the DNA of a parasite, making it unable to reproduce. But the parasite must pass through the ultraviolet system, which can take six hours, before it comes back into the pool clean. \"Before all the water gets treated, crypto is still sitting in the water,\" Hlavsa said. Hyperchlorination does a great job of lowering the amount of crypto in a pool, but it doesn’t have a lasting effect, Hlavsa said. Six Flags Hurricane Harbor, which had no crypto cases last year, is among several facilities planning to hyperchlorinate its pools. \"It’s the easiest and most effective thing to do,\" park spokeswoman Sharon Parker said. Keller has considered a UV system but for now will focus on educating the public about healthy swimming habits and following the public health department’s recommendations, said Dona Roth Kinney, director of parks and recreation. The bottom line is that it’s up to people to prevent an outbreak by avoiding public pools for 10 days if they have had gastrointestinal symptoms, Jefferson said. \"Swimmers are bringing it into the pools, and they’re the ones who can keep it out,\" he said. Wash your hands after using the toilet or changing diapers. Change diapers in a bathroom or diaper-changing area and not at poolside. Wash children thoroughly with soap and water before they go swimming.",

At 4, she ran down the aisle of an Ohio church saying: \"I love Jesus! I love Jesus! Baptize me!\" Church leaders didn’t believe in baptizing a child so young, but she was adamant, so they relented, relatives said last week. She was the one to encourage the family to have a weekend barbecue, to get her parents to take a trip to Cancun, to find the best deals on a cute handbag. \"She was kind of like the one who kept things moving,\" said her mother, Mamie Underwood. Ms. Underwood, 34, of Arlington, died Tuesday of an unknown cause. The Tarrant County medical examiner’s office is investigating the cause of death. Ms. Underwood was an answer to her parents’ prayers for a child, her mother said. She was the second of three. \"She was a prayer warrior,\" her mother said. \"She was a fervent believer in God and his power and in praying and the power of prayer. She believed when there was a problem to pray.\" Ms. Underwood, born Dec. 20, 1974, spent the first 10 years of her life in Wintersville, Ohio, before the family moved to Arlington. Her father is an engineer, and her mother is an employee of the federal General Services Administration. Ms. Underwood was an honor student and graduated from O.D. Wyatt High School in Fort Worth in 1993. She attended law school at Texas Southern University in Houston. Her younger sister, Kalena Horhn of Grand Prairie, said she remembers riding on a Big Wheel with her big sister in front. \"She was full of wisdom, of hopes and of dreams,\" she said. Ms. Underwood’s mother said she often went out of her way to help others. When a friend lost her job, Ms. Underwood invited her to stay with her, rent free. \"Her heart was not as big as Texas,\" her mother said. \"It was bigger than Texas.\" Other survivors include a 15-month old son, Kingston James, and her father, Gary Underwood. Her funeral was Saturday.",

MANSFIELD — The Law Enforcement Center will get some parking relief and other improvements and repairs if the City Council approves a $765,000 financing package today. About $85,000 has already been used for emergency repairs to mechanical and electrical systems. Among the remaining projects is expanding parking at the center to keep up with the growing number of staff members. \"We’ve been out of parking for years,\" Patrol Commander Kyle Lanier said. The council meeting is at 7 p.m. at City Hall, 1200 E. Broad St. Lanier said the renovations, which could begin by mid-April, would also include electrical work, fencing, gates, painting and landscaping. None of the scheduled improvements are for the patrol division, where officers are finishing their own volunteer remodeling effort. They have replaced drywall, repainted, installed cabinets and overhauled bathrooms, saving $50,000 to $100,000, they say. In other action, the council will consider authorizing staff to take advantage of lower interest rates and refinance about $10.3 million of city debt. Officials estimate savings of $450,000 over the life of the bonds. Last week, after recent action by the council, late Public Safety Director Steve Noonkester’s name was placed on the side of the Mansfield Public Safety and Municipal Court Building. The new lettering dedicates the building to Noonkester but doesn’t change its name — part of a compromise with some residents opposed to naming any city building for individuals.",

    "sentence": "Arlington woman ran framing shop, practiced Baha’i faith. ARLINGTON — Jahan Nazarian was born into a Jewish family in western Iran’s Kermanshah province on May 2, 1923. In her 20s, she married Noorallah Moayyad, a man of the Baha’i faith, which advocates the unity of world religious and teaches that leaders such as Jesus, Muhammad and Buddha were all divine prophets. After growing up Jewish, \" she had to embrace Christianity and then embrace Islam, and she understood that religions come in succession and improve,\" said Ms. Moayyad’s daughter-in-law Nadia Moayyad of Southlake. Ms. Moayyad died Saturday of complications from a stroke. She was 85. After 30 years of raising a family and practicing Baha’i in Iran, Ms. Moayyad and her husband moved to North Texas in 1973, Nadia Moayyad said, in part to be near their five children, who were all living in the United States. None has been able to return since the Islamic Republic under Ayatollah Khomeini supplanted the Shah of Iran. \"All of the Baha’is had to leave Iran during the revolution because of the religious persecution,\" Nadia Moayyad said. \"We don’t know when we will ever go back until there is religious freedom and then respect for all faiths.\" Ms. Moayyad spoke only French and Farsi when she moved to Arlington, Nadia Moayyad said. She soon learned English so she could get her driver’s license. The Moayyads started a business, U Frame It, in Arlington. After her husband died in 1992, she allowed two grandchildren to take over the store, although she still worked there for several years. \"She was a very kind and loving lady,\" Nadia Moayyad said. \"I think her presence there was always felt with the customers.\" Ms. Moayyad’s funeral will be observed by a family saddened by the loss but bolstered by the Baha’i belief that death is a new beginning. \"It’s not a sad occasion,\" Nadia Moayyad said. \"It’s really a birth to a world where our soul is going to live eternally.\" Other survivors include sons Parviz Moayyad of Houston, Edward Moayyad of Southlake and Hamid Moayyad of Colleyville; daughters Parvin Davari and Nasrin Sadeghan, both of California; 13 grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.",

    "sentence": "Arlington council OKs drilling near residential area. ARLINGTON — The City Council voted 8-1 Tuesday to approve a gas-drilling site on a picturesque horse farm in north Arlington. Titan Operating was granted a specific-use permit to drill on 3.5 acres of Martha Rose May Martin’s 40-acre horse farm at North Cooper Street and Green Oaks Boulevard. Titan, which has not drilled in Arlington before, plans to drill 20 wells on Martin’s farm over five years. The company spent more than $23 million acquiring mineral rights from 2,200 property owners surrounding the site. On Tuesday night, more than 200 residents packed City Hall to weigh in on the proposal, most to voice support. Among those in favor of the site was former Mayor Elzie Odom, who was one of 2,200 property owners in the North Arlington Neighbors association who signed a lease with Titan last year. Martin told the council that the decision to allow drilling on her property, which features open pastures, rolling hills and grazing horses, was not taken lightly. \"I have a profound love and connection with my property, which has been owned by my family for six generations,\" she said. \"This property is a little bit of heaven for my family and neighbors.\" Councilman Robert Rivera, who represents southeast Arlington, voted against the permit, saying he shared concerns about safety and property values with residents near the site. Three months ago, the city’s Planning and Zoning Commission unanimously rejected Titan’s request. Commissioners did not publicly comment on why they denied the permit, but city staff and council members have expressed concerns about the gas wells’ impact on the land’s future development, the visibility of the wells from busy Cooper Street, and the effects of an industrial operation on property values and quality of life. Cliff Mycoskie, who presented Titan’s permit request to council, said the gas company has agreed to implement several measures that will reduce the operation’s impact. Among them, he said: Titan will use urban drilling rigs, which require less energy to run and can be assembled more quickly, put up sound buffers, limit truck traffic during peak hours and install a masonry fence and landscaping along Cooper Street before drilling begins, which could be as soon as next year. Mycoskie pointed out that farther north, Huffines Communities wants to build a master planned community on undeveloped land across from the city landfill that already has numerous natural gas drilling sites. The community, called Viridian, will feature a town center and homes ranging from $300,000 to more than $1 million. \"If it worked at Viridian, it can work at this site, too,\" Cliff said. Those who spoke in opposition, many of whom live within 600 feet of the site, said they were concerned about the safety of living so close to an industrial site and the negative effects on property values. They also said they were disappointed to lose the peace and great view they have from living so close to the farm. Melinda Vanderberg, who lives on Bucknell Drive, urged the council to consider alternate sites away from the neighborhood. \"This site is literally in my back yard. There are many families and they live dangerously close to this industrial drill site that is going to go on for seven years,\" she said. Resident Landry Burdine said nearby drilling sites on Washington Drive and at Rolling Hills Country Club could extract the gas. \"This is not a necessary drill site. There are ample drills sites to serve this area,\" said Burdine, a developer who put together the deal to acquire and demolish the dilapidated Madison Creek and Hampton Hills apartment complexes on Washington Drive to make way for a natural gas drilling site. Supporters of the permit said they believe Titan will keep its promises to minimize the effects of the drilling and preserve the horse farm’s character. Charles Parker said that residents have the right to access their minerals and that royalties would benefit people affected by the recession or are living on a fixed income. \"These rights are all inheritable. Whatever is pumping out of that ground when I’m dead and done is going to go to my children,\" Parker said. Ellen Boyer, North Arlington Neighbors organizer, said she supports natural gas drilling as a way for the country to move away from dependence on foreign energy. \"We have a responsibility to develop the natural gas resources with which we have been blessed,\" Boyer said. \"I know our development in north Arlington is only a baby step, but it’s a step in the right direction.\"",

An 80-year-old woman was killed this morning in Arlington when a neighbor accidentally hit her while backing out of a driveway. The woman was walking the 3800 block of Silkwood Trail in South Arlington about 7 a.m. when the collission occured, said Tiara Ellis, an Arlington spokeswoman. She was struck by an SUV driven by a female neighbor. The driver was leaving to take her 15-year-old son to school, Ellis said, when she felt resistance while backing out of the driveway. After pulling the car forward, she saw the 80-year-old. The son called 911. Ellis said the driver told police that while she'd seen the elderly woman walking in the neighborhood before, she didn't see her when she started backing out of the driveway today. Poor visibility related to the rain may have been a factor, police said. Police are still investigating, but no criminal charges are expected. “It looks like it was just an unfortunate accident,” Ellis said.",

Grand Prairie police are investigating the death of a 16-year-old who was killed and another who was injured early Sunday after an altercation at an Arlington party. The Tarrant County Medical Examiner identified the Arlington teen as Mitchell Taleferio, but police said Taleferio was the teen’s first name. According to police, Taleferio was at a party with friends and may have gotten into an altercation with another group of teens. After he left the party with his friends, their red 1991 Honda broke down and they stopped at an Exxon gas station on Mayfield Road and State Highway 360 to fix it. A red Dodge Durango with a group of teens who may have been at the party also drove to the gas station and started fighting with Taleferio and his friends. Taleferio and his friends left the gas station and stopped about a half-mile away at a light at Forum Drive and Mayfield Road in Grand Prairie when the Durango pulled up next to them. Shots fired from the Durango struck Taleferio in the back of the head, police said. The Honda's driver, another 16-year-old, also was struck and suffered non-life threatening injuries. The injured teen drove to USMD Medical Center in Arlington, and Taleferio was later airlifted to John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth where he was pronounced dead, authorities said.",

    "sentence": "School layoff policies rethought . School districts aren't yet laying off teachers, but most in Northeast Georgia either are reviewing or changing policies that will allow them to fire veteran teachers if they need to. The policies make seniority less of a priority when deciding which teachers to keep and which ones to let go - part of a trend that started more than 10 years ago to allow school districts to keep newer teachers with promise even if they had to cut positions. Last week, the Clarke County Board of Education began to take public comment on a new policy that would replace a 25-year-old rule that made seniority the only factor when administrators eliminate jobs. And in January, the Oconee County school board made similar changes to its policy, deciding to use a ranking system for seniority as a secondary measure to evaluate the value of an employee. Most Northeast Georgia school systems haven't had to consider layoff policies - dubbed \"reduction-in-force plans\" - for two decades because enrollment growth forced schools to hire more and more. But enrollment has slowed in places like Jackson and Barrow counties - which were among the fastest-growing counties in the state a few years ago - and since state funding is tied to enrollment, that means less state funding. Plus, the state reduced funding for public schools across the board by 2 percent this year, while next year's plans call for an additional 3 percent reduction - worth about $7.3 million for a school system like Barrow County. To make up for funding cuts, schools have implemented a hiring freeze and are not replacing many teachers who retire or move away. At the same time, property values and sales tax revenues are stagnant, meaning there is likely to be less local money for schools. As administrators consider cutting staff, some systems are revisiting their policies to make sure they can keep teachers with stellar records and teachers who can coach or have an in-demand specialty like special education, even if they have fewer years on the job. While Clarke and Oconee update their layoff policies, school boards in Barrow, Jackson and Madison counties tweaked their own only a few years ago. Under the newer policies, even tenured teachers who work in a district for more than four years aren't guaranteed they'll keep their jobs, said Phil Hartley, an attorney for the Georgia School Boards Association. \"It's becoming harder and harder to justify 'How do we get rid of the five-year teacher whose test scores are superior to the 20-year veteran teacher's?\" Hartley said. \"The school district has to have a way of making a decision based on criteria that it feels it can fairly apply for a reduction in force.\" School administrators still will consider a teacher's seniority, but only after looking at job evaluations, classroom observations and test scores. Seniority-based layoff policies still are the standard for most large school districts. Today, all but five of the nation's 25 largest school districts use seniority as a basis for cutting staff, according to the National Council on Teacher Quality, a Washington-based organization that encourages stronger state teacher-quality policies. Still, basing layoff decisions on more subjective standards may have flaws, too, said Tim Callahan, a spokesman for the Professional Association of Georgia Educators. \"If performance would be the sole criteria for a reduction-in-force, I think there would be a great amount of subjectivity and unfairness because of the system that we have,\" Callahan said. \"I think if the reduction-in-force plan considers several matters including performance, there might be more of a chance for fairness, but frankly, what we're hearing out there is mass reductions at the cheapest possible rate with not a whole lot of care and thought into a reduction-in-force policy.\"",

    "sentence": "New call for help in lynch case . MONROE - Federal and state law enforcement officials are nearly certain there are people living who can help them solve the 1946 Moore's Ford lynching. Top brass from the federal Department of Justice and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation made a plea Saturday in Monroe - just a few miles from the site of the country's last mass-lynching - for the public's help with one of their coldest cases. \"With a pretty good degree of certainty, almost 100 percent, there are individuals here in Walton County who can help us solve this and provide details that would fill in the blank,\" said Gregory Jones, special agent in charge of the FBI's Atlanta office. Jones, GBI Director Vernon Keenan and Cynthia Deitle, the FBI's civil rights unit chief, were among the panelists at a Saturday discussion and film screening on the murders in the Walton County seat. Law enforcement officials sought to show they are serious about prosecuting the murders, in which an angry white mob shot to death two black sharecroppers and their wives July 25, 1946, at the Moore's Ford bridge between Walton and Oconee counties. They also wanted to continue publicizing the case and call for anyone with information to come forward and help with the investigation. \"If we could solve the case through sheer resources, that would be done, but that is not what occurs,\" Keenan said. \"We've got to have cooperation from people who have direct knowledge or evidence about what happened. They have got to work with law enforcement for us to be able to prevail and solve this case.\" At the same time, the panelists admitted the difficulties inherent in investigating a nearly 63-year-old case and tried to tamp down expectations. \"We still have some things to do, but I certainly don't want to raise expectations,\" Jones said. However, he said, \"We're not finished, and there are a number of things that we continue to pick up on.\" No matter how gruesome the crime, the rules of evidence still apply, Keenan said. The horrific nature of the lynching of Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey, and the national attention it received in the summer of 1946, caused federal officials to put an \"unprecedented amount of pressure\" on FBI agents to solve the case back then, Jones said. Two dozen federal agents swarmed the area, interviewing people and identifying 160 persons of interest. But they ran into a wall of silence from the local community and couldn't put together a case to arrest anyone. Today, the case still is a priority for the FBI and GBI, the panelists said, but they still face a problem with cooperation from people who may know something. \"It's not just a standard cold case homicide,\" said Deitle, whose office is in charge of investigating a number old civil rights era crimes. \"It's also a case where some victims' relatives, witnesses and even some perpetrators are still paralyzed by a climate of fear.\" Of the 107 cold cases the FBI currently is reviewing, the Moore's Ford lynching is the oldest and involves the most victims and alleged perpetrators, Deitle said. There have been a few breaks in the case in recent years, though none appear to have gone anywhere. Last year, FBI and GBI agents executed a search warrant at a house in Walton County's rural Gratis community. After digging in the backyard of the home, agents seized some items and sent them to the GBI's crime lab. Keenan declined to discuss the items seized or any other evidence in the case Saturday because it could inhibit the ongoing investigation. Several years ago, Keenan thought about releasing to the public the GBI's investigative file on Moore's Ford, he said following Saturday's event. He discussed it with the state attorney general, but they decided against it because there still is a chance of prosecution, he said. \"I have seen many cases that we considered to be stagnant that ... there was no activity on and then with a phone call we suddenly piece together a case and go forward with an arrest and prosecution,\" he said. \"That has happened many times in my career so I never believe that a case is hopeless. And I don't believe this one is.\" Saturday's event, sponsored by the Moore's Ford Memorial Committee, also featured a screening of filmmaker Keith Beauchamp's documentary on the killings for the TV One network.",

    "sentence": "Attorney insists client not competent for trial . The attorney for a mentally ill man accused of stabbing an Athens-Clarke police officer nearly to death wants another jury to consider whether the defendant is competent to stand trial. Assistant public defender Benjamin Pearlman is arguing that, after a one-day civil trial last fall, a jury contradicted a state psychologist's finding that Steven Anthony Eberhart is incompetent. And, he said, mental health professionals still believe Eberhart isn't sane enough to understand what he did or help in his defense. Pearlman keeps in contact with the staff at East Central Regional Hospital, and every specialist involved in treating Eberhart \"continues to have the opinion that he is still not competent to stand trial,\" Pearlman argued in documents filed last month in Clarke County Superior Court. Pearlman can't defend Eberhart effectively, because his client can't hold a rational conversation about his case, he said. \"It's basically unconstitutional to put a person like that on trial, and it's my responsibility to say that Steven's not in the state of mind to stand trial,\" Pearlman said. \"Even if a jury found he might have been competent before, when someone has mental health issues, their status can change month to month, day to day,\" he said. Authorities say Eberhart, 45, attacked Sgt. Courtney Gale with a kitchen knife on Dec. 11, 2007, repeatedly stabbing the uniformed officer as she worked an off-duty security guard job in the Kroger store on Alps Road. Gale spent two weeks in a coma, had several surgeries to save one of her legs and went through extensive physical and cognitive rehabilitation. A grand jury indicted Eberhart on a criminal attempt to commit murder charge and 10 other felonies, and in September, a civil panel in Clarke County Superior Court determined that Eberhart, though he has a history of schizophrenia, is competent to stand trial. Jurors heard a state Department of Human Resources psychologist testify that Eberhart continued to \"experience psychotic delusions, consistent with his diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia,\" according to court documents. Eberhart has been held at the Augusta psychiatric hospital since soon after his arrest in December 2007. He couldn't attend his own arraignment hearing Feb. 4, so the court entered a not guilty plea on his behalf. Pearlman filed the request for a second competency trial immediately after the jury finding. Prosecutors are not required to respond, and Superior Court Chief Judge Lawton Stephens has yet to rule on the request. Pearlman already asked the state Court of Appeals to overturn the competency decision, but the court dismissed the appeal in December, stating it lacked jurisdiction. District Attorney Ken Mauldin declined to comment on the request for another competency hearing, other than to say, \"Of course, (Eberhart's) already been found competent by a jury, and they are raising that issue again, saying he's not competent at this time.\"",

    "sentence": "Madison will dump assessors . DANIELSVILLE - Madison County commissioners voted Monday to wipe clean the county Board of Tax Assessors by dismissing all four members. The county attorney will draft a letter of dismissal for the assessors laying out the reasons they're being dismissed and letting them know when they can appear before commissioners to tell their side of the story. Monday's vote, which was unanimous, comes after commissioners voted to take away the assessors' power over personnel and after Commission Chairman Anthony Dove requested that all the assessors resign. The tax assessors office and its governing board have been in turmoil for years and failed to finish the county's tax digest on time for nearly a decade. The chronically late digests - compilations of the value of all taxable county property - have caused confusion for taxpayers, who may have to pay two years' worth of taxes in 2009, Dove said at Monday's meeting. \"When you're hired to do a job, if you do not do your job in a week, you're let go - certainly, if you do not do that job in years,\" he said. Dove said he was forced to take action after the assessors recommended only one candidate in four months to fill the long-open job of chief appraiser and after the interim chief offered her resignation this month. Commissioners Stanley Thomas and John Pethel agreed that problems with the assessors had gone on long enough. \"Every section of the county, every taxpayer is concerned about this tax situation,\" Thomas said. Although the assessors board's chairman has promised to bring this year's digest in on time, \"we're further behind now than we have been in the last two or three years,\" Pethel said. \"I don't know how he intends to get the digest out without a chief appraiser.\" Commissioners voted to dismiss the assessors after a brief closed-door session Monday night. Commissioners also said they would vote next month on Dove's recommendation for a new chief appraiser. Before closing the meeting to the public, Commissioner Mike Youngblood pointed out that Board of Assessors Chairman David Ragland has been on the board for only seven months. Assessors Jim Escoe and Larry Stewart, who were appointed by commissioners in August 2005, attended Monday's meeting. Ragland and board Vice Chairwoman Samantha Garland, who was appointed in April 2004, were not there. Escoe said after the meeting he's approached commissioners at least a couple of times to explain the problems in the tax office, but he's been ignored. \"They don't want to know what the problem is,\" he said. \"They think the problem exists in everything.\" The assessors don't plan on backing down by resigning, and Escoe said he would take his case to a judge. \"I relish this; I want this,\" he said. \"Now we can go and get this out in the public.\"",

With the threat of wildfires greatly reduced by heavy rains, commissioners unanimously voted for an end to the ban. County Fire Marshal John Holcomb presented the commissioners with the latest information from the Texas Forest Service, showing the county in the blue category on the Keetch-Byrum Drought Index indicating ample moisture in the soil. According to Athens Review rainfall records, about seven inches fell last week. “I make a motion to lift the burn ban immediately,” Precinct 3 Commissioner Ronny Lawrence said. County Judge David Holstein noted that the ban, which had been in effect since February 11, was lifted as of 9:45 a.m.In other action, commissioners voted 3-2 to deny a request from Pct. 4 Constable Rick Stewart for a larger patrol vehicle, but left the door open to discuss the issue during budget talks beginning in June. Stewart told commissioners in January that he had difficulty exiting his Chevrolet Impala patrol car during an incident in Frankston in which he fatally shot 29-year-old Jason Jermaine Cumby of Athens. He asked for a larger car or a Chevrolet S-10 pick-up. Pct. 4 Commissioner Jerry West made the motion to approve Stewart’s request. “I felt that it needed to be addressed because of the situation in Frankston,” West said. Pct. 1 Commissioner Joe Hall seconded West’s motion. “Big guys do have a major problem when they get in and out of some of these cars,” Hall said. “Some of these vehicles they drive, I couldn’t drive them.” Pct. 2 Commissioner Wade McKinney objected to make the change so close to the beginning of work on the 2010 budget. “I know we’re asking a great deal of them by not doing it, but I’m looking to the coming budget year,” McKinney said. West said Stewart and others had asked for larger vehicles in past budget sessions without success. West and Hall voted in favor of allowing Stewart to get a new vehicle. McKinney, Holstein and Pct. 3 Commissioner Ronny Lawrence were opposed. On other agenda items, commissioners approved: a contract to be presented by the Henderson County Sheriff’s Department to other counties for the purposes of housing out-of-county inmates in the Henderson County Jail; a contract with Marex group for software to be used for digitizing court records dating from 1950; a contract with Diminsion Imaging to scan the records; a 2008 bill from Templeton Construction for work on the jail in the amount of $34,070.05 (the vote was 4-1 with McKinney opposed); and bills from 2009 in the amount of $564,740.07.",

Costly acts of mischief have been happening around city businesses, roadways over last several months The Athens Police Department is asking for the public’s help in finding those responsible for painting graffiti on various buildings and structures around the city. The most recent cases of criminal mischief were reported Tuesday morning. During the night, someone spraypainted Dunn’s Automotive and Norman’s Welding on West Tyler Street. Symbols and obscenities had also been painted on the concrete portion of the railroad overpass on West Corsicana Street, APD reports state. “It appears to be a small group of kids that’s going around spraypainting on the buildings,” Detective Sgt.

People have to paint over it and it’s done several thousand dollars damage.” Most of the occurrences have been in the north and west portions of the city, Yarbrough said. Often the painting involves gang symbols. The cases of mischief have been more abundant over the past two months. “They’ve hit buildings, storage building places, sidewalks,” Yarbrough said. “They’ve done a little bit of everything. We believe they’re doing it late at night.” The property owners usually discover the damage the following morning and are unable to offer a description of the individuals. “So far we have no idea who it is. We hope if someone sees them doing it they’ll give us a call,” Yarbrough said. Anyone with information that leads to the arrest of the vandals can contact Henderson County Crimestoppers at 903-675-8477. Callers can remain anonymous. Yarbrough said anyone with information may also call him at the Athens Police Department at 903-675-5454.",

    "sentence": "City Council talks money. Sales tax revenue is down, but officials say budget is still ‘in line’ The Athens City Council was given a budget update on Wednesday morning. “It is no surprise sales tax was down,” Director of Finance David Hopkins said at the special session. Hopkins said sales tax revenues were down 6.86 percent from last year. He said revenues are down 5 percent overall from last year. Hopkins said the city has saved money in other areas to help balance the budget. It saved $15,000 to $20,000 on its health insurance premiums, lower gas prices and attrition, according to Hopkins. “Everything else is pretty much in line,” he said. “The one bright spot is the hotel/motel tax.” The occupancy tax revenues have increased about $10,000 over last year. He said the revenues have been trending downward over the last two months. Hopkins said the city has about $400,000 in reserves if needed. The council also discussed:â ¢ canceling the May 9 City of Athens general elections. City Administrator Pam Burton said only Mayor Randy Daniel and Councilmember Place 1 Jerry Don Vaught filed for the two available seats. Since the law allowing entities without a contested race to cancel elections went into effect in 1996, Athens has had few contested municipal races.

The council voted on Jan. 13 to put the matter on hold for 60 days. Burton said at the time the council should wait to see what the economic conditions would be before committing to spending the $39,500. “As you can tell there has not been any positive change,” Burton said. Athens Mayor Randy Daniel said caution is advised at this time of the budget year.",

    "sentence": "Area woman sentenced for mortgage fraud. CORSICANA — A Henderson County woman was sentenced to 99 years in prison for her role in a mortgage fraud scheme on Monday. On March 17, a Navarro County jury found the defendant, Kandace Yancy Marriott, 52, of Gun Barrel City, guilty of engaging in organized criminal activity. According to prosecutors, evidence presented at the punishment stage showed Marriott received monthly mortgage payments from her clients, failed to remit those payments to the mortgage lender, embezzled the homeowners’ funds, and therefore caused her clients to default on their home loans. Marriott’s conviction stems from her involvement in a complex mortgage fraud scheme that defrauded the federal government. The scheme’s principal operators were the defendant and her husband, Darrell L. Marriott, 54, who sold manufactured homes through their company, One Way Home & Land. However, the defendants’ daughter, Kally Marriott, and Mrs. Marriott’s sister, Karen Hayes, have also been indicted for their role in the scheme. All four defendants face separate charges for related criminal conduct in Kaufman County. According to state investigators, the defendants illegally forged home buyers’ signatures, inaccurately completed loan applications, and falsified supporting documents, including the buyers’ rent payment verification statements, proof of employment, and Social Security Administration benefits data, among other items. Court documents filed by the state indicate that the defendants conduct was intended to ensure that unqualified home buyers loans were approved by mortgage lenders. The scheme involved predominantly low-income purchasers whose residential loans were guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. As a result, when the unqualified buyers defaulted on their home loans, their mortgage lenders did not suffer financial losses. Instead, HUD — and therefore the taxpayers — had to cover the default costs. Investigators believe the defendants’ scheme cost the taxpayers more than $3 million. The defendants closed the One Way Home & Land after litigation and investigations ensued in late 2005. As a result, they opened a Kaufman County firm under the assumed name, Torenia. Additional criminal charges in Kaufman County stem from the defendants’ Torenia operation. The Office of the Attorney General received assistance from the Navarro County Criminal District Attorney’s Office, Corsicana Police Department and HUD Office of Inspector General. Attorney General Abbott’s Criminal Prosecutions Division is leading the prosecution of the four defendants with the cooperation of district attorneys’ offices in Navarro, Henderson and Ellis counties. For more information on Attorney General Abbott’s efforts to crack down on mortgage fraud, contact the Office of the Attorney General at (800) 252-8011 or visit the agency’s Web site at www.texasattorneygeneral.gov.",

    "sentence": "Area funeral director charged in robberies. An Alton funeral director has been charged with robbing two Indiana banks of more than $10,000. Vanderburgh, Ind., County prosecutors last week charged George R, Chesnut with robbing Evansville Federal Credit Union on Dec. 5. The 46-year-old Chesnut was already in custody for allegedly robbing the First Bank of Princeton on March 6. Employees at First Bank told police that a man approached the counter at 4:45 p.m. wearing a baseball cap, a gray hooded jacket, blue jeans and white shoes and lifted his jacket to show the butt of a handgun tucked into his waistband, according to a search warrant. The warrant was filed Tuesday in Madison County for Chesnut's home in the 2400 block of Gillis Street in Alton. The man passed an index card to the teller which read \"This a robbery. I have a gun. Do not call Police. Give me your hundreds, fifties and twenties. \"An off-duty police officer stopped Chesnut's Ford Mustang, bearing Illinois license plates, a short while later. The officer traced the plates to the Gillis Street address. He found $4,470 in a bag inside the engine compartment, according to an affidavit filed with the search warrant. Chesnut matched the description of a suspect in the Dec. 5 bank robbery in which a man wearing a dark hooded jacket entered the bank and showed the teller the butt of his gun and demanded cash. Three tellers were working at the time, and the man approached her window speaking on a cell phone, according to a Vanderburgh County Sheriff's report. A teller gave him $5,800, according to the affidavit. The teller later picked Chesnut out of a police lineup, according to the report. On March 7, FBI agents searched Chesnut's home. They seized bank statements, collection notices, credit reports and bank notices that indicated that his Godfrey funeral business was struggling, according to the return.",

    "sentence": "Keeping track of every dollar. NOTICE: This is the final article in a series that looks back over the past couple of years at the accomplishments of the District 7 Board of Education and ahead to the anticipated challenges it faces. The day-to-day business operations, the working relationships with government entities and officials, and the financing of the school district are all critically important areas and the focus of today’s final article. When in April, 2007, taxpayers approved the $58.3 million referendum to build Albert Cassens Elementary, Goshen Elementary and make major renovations to EHS South and Glen Carbon Elementary, and convert the Alternative School to the new Worden Elementary, the Board of Education made some commitments to taxpayers that Edwardsville District 7 Superintendent Ed Hightower noted as two important financial achievements. “During the campaign, the Board of Education made a promise that the tax rate would not change, and as a matter of fact, it dropped slightly,” Hightower said. “That’s been accomplished.” Hightower pointed out that the second promise the Board of Education had made was that the building bond component of the district’s tax rate would remain consistent for the 20 year term to payoff the $58.3 million. The board assured that the building bond rate would not increase or would be less from the then current rate of approximately .58. The current rate is at approximately .54 which Hightower noted as a second achievement. Hightower emphasized that the bond rate was at this lower rate due to conservative planning in regards to estimating the Equalized Assessed Valuation (EAV). The State of Illinois’ Web site defines the EAV as “the result of applying the state equalization factor to the assessed value of a parcel of property. Tax bills are then calculated by multiplying the EAV (after any deductions for homesteads) by the tax rate.” Although the district had seen EAV growth rates averaging between 11 and 12 percent, the board estimated a rate much lower to be conservative. The EAV growth rate is estimated at 8.5 percent for the 2008 levy but future years will be even lower. “The 2009 levy for the 2010-11 fiscal year will be at 7 percent and continue thereafter for the life of the bonds,” Hightower said. “That’s pretty conservative. That’s all built in.” “When we set the 20 year issue up, we tried to be conservative,” Assistant Superintendent of Business Operations Dave Courtney said. “After the first couple of years, we had done an estimate on EAV that was at 7 percent rather than the 10, 11, 12, 13 percent that we were seeing before.” Courtney noted that by using the 7 percent figure “we were able to maintain a consistent rate on the entire 20 year term.” While speaking about financing, the topic of the district’s loss of revenue arose. When asked about the $1.5 million loss of revenue to the school district as the result of TIFs (Tax Increment Financing) as suggested by mayoral candidate Wesley Tippit in his door-to-door campaigning, Hightower emphatically responded, “Let me just say that. . . it is misleading and it is totally inaccurate. It’s nowhere near $1.5 million dollars.” The City of Edwardsville currently has three TIF districts: TIF I and TIF II in the downtown area, and TIF III at Gateway Commerce Center. The Edwardsville City Council approved in 2008 a fourth TIF plan for an area in downtown Edwardsville from the intersection of East College to the intersection of Illinois Route 159 and Old Alton Edwardsville Road. To illustrate his point, Hightower went on to explain that Courtney estimated a loss of only $66,000 for TIF I and about $54,000 for TIF II. In addition, Courtney provided estimates of losses to TIF III at approximately $127,000 and TIF IV is currently at about $3,000. Hightower also felt the TIFs provided numerous benefits. “When you look at what has happened there (downtown) in the last 20 years,” Hightower said. “Look at the development, look at the number of improvements that have been made and the number of people employed. That is adding a benefit to this community.” “It is so unfair that the school district would be used in this type of a campaign – it’s untrue,\" Hightower said. \" When you consider all of the improvements that have been made and you ask yourself the question, ‘Has the quality of life improved? Has economic development improved in this area?’ The answer would be yes.” Another accomplishment of the board was its role in the construction of Governors’ Parkway from 157 to District Drive and Glen Crossing Road in Glen Carbon. Hightower stated that extending Governors’ Parkway allowed 30 to 35 percent of the traffic to be diverted off of Goshen Road in addition to providing Vicksburg residents with another exit onto Governors’ Parkway. He said that the new road allowed for a reduction in bus transportation in that area which was a savings to the district and that the new road improves traffic flow throughout the city of Edwardsville. He also noted that the completed extension would soon allow for travel from 157 all the way to 143 near the Interstate 55 entrance ramp. Hightower attributed the success of this project to a collaboration of many key individuals. “Mayor Gary Niebur has done an incredible job of leading and working collaboratively with the school district and Representative Jay Hoffman in getting the millions of dollars to complete Governors’ Parkway from 157 all the way to 143,” Hightower said. “Without collaboration, without working together, this could not have been done, and a great deal of credit goes to Mayor Gary Niebur and city officials for their hard work in getting this done.” According to Hightower, the same group effort occurred in Glen Carbon in getting Glen Crossing complete. “We were able to work collaboratively with Mayor Jackstadt, the village trustees and Representative Hoffman was able to bring that money to the area,” he said. Noting that phase one of the project had been in the Village of Glen Carbon’s budget, but phase two was not, Hightower added that, “If Goshen Elementary School, if Cassens Elementary School would not have been part of the two road construction projects, that money would not have been filtered to this area as expeditiously as it was.” Looking ahead at the challenges the Board of Education will face in the next two years, Hightower said that the major challenge is “the uncertainty at the state level and the impact that the national economy is having.” “The number two challenge will be, financially, that we keep focus, live within our means, and not be tempted to use our reserves as our primary bridge for funding day to day operations of the school district,” he said. “We must continue to hold the line, be fiscally responsible and do everything that we can to not impact student learning.” He further stated that the goals would be ”keeping class sizes where they are currently, not cutting teachers, keeping employees to the extent that we can, intact, and maintaining a three-year financial plan that will guide and lead the district without having to use our reserves – other than for the unanticipated occurrences that happens in the district.” Should the district be fortunate and receive stimulus funds, Hightower said that the district will be in a more stabilized position. But he also stressed that the current budget reductions to increase revenues were “not anything that any other responsible entity around the country should be doing at this time.” “We have an obligation and a responsibility of running the district like it’s a business with an understanding that we have an obligation to educate our students, and that we will do,” Hightower said.",

    "sentence": "Voice of experience speaks in Maryville. It began like an ordinary Sunday worship service, but at First Baptist Church Maryville, it wasn’t an ordinary Sunday. It was the first worship service in the large sanctuary since their pastor, The Rev. Dr. Fred Winters, was killed there last Sunday. The Rev. Al Meredith, senior pastor of Wedgewood Baptist Church in Fort Worth, Texas, brought a message of hope to the congregation in Maryville in three services Sunday morning. Ten years ago, a gunman entered his church in Fort Worth and killed seven people and wounded several others. Meredith escaped harm. The differences in the church shootings, Meredith noted, were in the number killed and the fact that the one killed in Maryville was the shepherd of the flock. “If this church is going to make it, it will be by the grace of God,” Meredith repeated the message he gave in interviews this week. “Isaiah said, ‘Strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter. ’”To prevent this happening to the Maryville church, he told members Sunday, “You’ve got to step up to the plate.” The world is searching for hope, he said. He told of the Russian submarine tragedy when several members of the crew survived at the bottom of the sea until their oxygen ran out. Divers, who heard tapping when they reached the sub, interpreted the Morse code: “Is there any hope?” All of the sailors aboard the sunken submarine perished. He said as Winston Churchill lay dying, he met for a few minutes with The Rev. Billy Graham and his question for the evangelist was, “Is there any hope?” Graham would have told him of the heavenly hope. Meredith said he left his church in Fort Worth with the blessing of his congregation to bring the message to Maryville and to the world, “In Jesus Christ there is hope.” He named several of the ones who were slain at the Fort Worth church a decade ago and told the story of Jeremiah, a young man who may have stopped the slaughter. He called the young man a “baby Christian,” who faced the gunman and said, “You need Jesus Christ in your life.” As the gunman turned on him, Jeremiah spread his arms and said, “Go ahead – shoot me. I know where I’m going – do you? Whereupon, the gunman slumped into one of the seats and turned his gun on himself. “You are what you are under pressure,” Meredith said. “What do you get when you squeeze an orange?” He nodded in agreement with the response, “Orange juice,” and added, “You don’t get Dr. Pepper.” He told the congregation that they will never get over the shooting of their pastor, but they will get through it. Meredith said a church secretary lived across from the church, but wasn’t at the scene of the shooting. Her husband, a law enforcement officer put out a call for all police available to go to the church, but by the time they arrived it was over. He later told Meredith that when he went into the church and saw the carnage and the spilled blood, he smelled the cordite from the bullets yet he could feel the presence of God. Later, as the investigation began, he went into the church and wondered if he had imagined that presence. He asked for a sign that he had felt the presence of God. The investigation turned up a hymnal that had stopped a bullet. “The bullet stopped at the page with the ‘Hallelujah Chorus,’” Meredith said. “It pointed to the words, ‘King of kings, Lord of lords – and he shall reign forever and ever,’ and he was convinced.” Meredith chose Romans 15:13 as his text Sunday. “Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.” Meredith said the verse promises hope now that everyone can receive through believing. Meredith often breaks into song during his sermons and he asked the congregation to join him in singing, “It is Well with My Soul.” Mindful that the man who killed Dr. Winters approached the pulpit down the center aisle, Meredith didn’t hesitate to give the invitation to those wishing to accept Jesus as savior, to come down the aisle toward him and several did.",

    "sentence": "Safety stressed on St. Patrick's Day. St. Patrick's Day is a time for fun and celebration, but it can also turn tragic when drinking and driving are involved. The Madison County Health Department and Madison County Partnership for Community Health Motor Vehicle Committee are reminding those who do choose to drink to do so responsibly by designating a sober driver before the party begins. “Statistics from the National Highway Traffic Administration show that over the past five years, 851 people lost their lives in motor vehicle crashes during the St. Patrick’s Day holiday. Out of that number, 327 were killed in crashes that involved a drunk driver with a blood alcohol concentration of .08 or higher,” a statement from the department says. MCHD Health Educator Jill Heuchert said the annual event is supposed to be a time to celebrate Irish heritage and to gather with friends, but that it can quickly turn deadly when alcohol is involved. “If you plan on drinking, don’t rely on luck to keep you safe or to keep your out of trouble. Be responsible and take appropriate precautions,” Heuchert said. The department offers these tips for party goers: Avoid drinking too much alcohol too fast. Pace yourself. Alternate with non-alcoholic drinks. Designate a sober driver before the party begins. Give that person your car keys. If you are impaired, don’t even consider driving. Ask a sober friend, call a cab, or stay where you are and sleep it off. Take the impaired person’s keys and never let a friend leave your sight if you think they are about to drive while under the influence. For those hosting a party: Serve lots of food, particularly high-protein dishes, and be sure to include lots of non-alcoholic beverages. Stop serving alcohol at the end of the early in the evening and begin serving coffee and dessert. Be sure all of your guests designate their drivers in advance, or help arrange ride-sharing with sober drivers. Keep the numbers for local cab companies handy and take the keys away from anyone who is thinking of driving while impaired. Never serve alcoholic beverages to individuals under 21 years of age. Persons wanting more information on alcohol or driving issues are asked to contact the Madison County Health Department at 692-7040, ext. 6086.",

    "sentence": "Leader of suicide group defends work. ATLANTA - A former assisted suicide network leader being prosecuted in a Georgia man's death is defending his group's practice of guiding people who want to kill themselves because they're suffering but not necessarily dying. At least three of the people known to have commited suicide through the Final Exit Network were not terminally ill. In his most extensive remarks since his arrest last month, Ted Goodwin told The Associated Press Tuesday that people with just months to live aren't the only ones who should be able to seek help committing suicide. \"These people who are terminally ill are blessed in a small way - there's a finite time for their suffering,\" said Goodwin, who stepped down as president of the network after his arrest. \"But there are many, many people who are doomed to suffer interminably for years. And why should they not receive our support as well?\" Critics within the right-to-die movement, including Dr. Jack Kevorkian, say people should be able to seek assistance ending their lives, but only from doctors and only if they're terminally ill. Georgia authorities say John Celmer, the 58-year-old man whose suicide led to charges against Goodwin and three others, was making a remarkable recovery from cancer when the group sent exit guides to his home to show him how to suffocate himself using helium tanks and a plastic hood. And police say that in 2007, the group helped an Arizona woman named Jana Van Voorhis who was depressed but not terminally ill. The third person, Kurt Perry, a suburban Chicago resident who was to have been the group's next suicide, has a debilitating neurological condition that is painful but usually not fatal. The 26-year-old said frightening breathing lapses prompted him to seek support from the network. \"Having them there with me would be a blessing and an honor,\" he said in an interview Tuesday. He was set to die Feb. 26, one day after Goodwin and the others were charged with violating Georgia's assisted suicide law. But he has since changed his mind, saying the arrests have given him new reason to live and help the group with its work. The network has drawn criticism from those who worry it isn't screening those who want to die carefully enough. \"You want to be sure before anyone is going to do anything like this that they're getting the best possible end-of-life care,\" said Dr. Timothy Quill, a professor of medicine at the University of Rochester and a supporter of Oregon and Washington laws that allow doctors to help terminally ill people end their lives. Goodwin, who is not a physician and founded the group in 2004 after his father died of emphysema, says the network helped guide nearly 200 people across the country die to but never actively assisted suicide. He says he was personally involved in 39 deaths. The arrests were the result of an eight-month investigation in which an undercover agent posing as someone bent on suicide infiltrated the group, which bases its work on \"The Final Exit,\" a best-selling suicide manual by British author Derek Humphry. Goodwin would not comment on the suicide process, but disputed Georgia authorities' contention that guides held down members' hands to prevent them from removing the hoods they placed over their heads while they breathed helium. \"We do not hold hands down. We do not cause them to suffer,\" he said. \"And this will be proven in a court of law - I promise you.\" Authorities have also questioned how carefully the group, which claims 3,300 members and donors and about 100 volunteers, screened people who want to commit suicide. Goodwin says the vetting process was tightened in 2007, after questions about Van Voorhis' death. Goodwin defended the group's involvement, saying Van Voorhis suffered from other illnesses, but people who sought help after her were asked to detail their complete mental history. About 30 percent of the applications the group received each year were from mentally ill people who wanted to die because of a lost job, lost spouse or other anguish. Those applications were immediately set aside, Goodwin said. If an applicant's mental history raised a concern, which happened occasionally, one of 10 psychiatrists or psychologists working with the group visited to assess the situation. But if it didn't, Goodwin said, the applicant got help, even though the group knew its work could one day lead to prosecution. \"We believe that it is the right of every mentally competent adult to determine whether he or she is suffering,\" Goodwin said. \"We do not believe this should be left to the physicians, church leaders or politicians. This is the right of every mentally competent individual to make this decision themselves.\"",

    "sentence": "Sanford rejects aid after second rebuff. COLUMBIA --- South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford said Friday he won't spend $700 million in federal stimulus cash, an announcement unlikely to affect whether the state gets the money and one that came after the Republican was twice rebuffed by the White House in his attempts to use the cash to pay off state debt. \"We're obviously disappointed by the White House's decision, because it cuts against the notion of federalism and the idea of each state having the flexibility to act in a manner that best suits its needs,\" Mr. Sanford said. \"As a result, we will not be seeking the use of these federal funds for the way they put our state even further into an unconscionable level of debt.\" Mr. Sanford has become a prominent voice in opposing federal bailouts. He contends that stimulus money won't increase employment and will merely add to federal debt that will lead to higher taxes. On Thursday, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said she would reject nearly a third of an estimated $930 million that could flow to her state. Mr. Sanford, who is in Nevada for Air Force Reserve training, released a statement about an hour after White House budget chief Peter Orszag denied his request to use a portion of federal stimulus money to pay off school construction debt. Mr. Orszag sent Mr. Sanford a letter Friday saying the money can't be used on debt payments and instead needs to restore funding cuts from state budgets and help aid schools. One of the goals of the $787 billion stimulus package is \"to make critical investments in long-term economic growth, such as providing every child the chance for a world-class education,\" Mr. Orszag wrote. In all, South Carolina is to get about $2.8 billion in federal stimulus money over two years. The state's mayors had implored Mr. Sanford to take all the money he could, and the Republican-dominated Legislature has already made plans to spend the portion the governor balked on. In January, South Carolina had the second-highest unemployment rate in the nation and officials had to cut $1 billion from a $7 billion budget as the recession dampened revenue collections. The House last week passed a $6.6 billion budget patched together with $1 billion in stimulus cash. Mr. Sanford's anti-bailout stance was one of the things that led House Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., to insert language into the bill allowing state legislators to override governors, a move that has raised constitutional concerns. Mr. Clyburn disagrees. \"For one, nobody is sidestepping the governor. The governor is taking himself out of the game,\" Mr. Clyburn said. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Hugh Leatherman, R-Florence, said taking the money over Mr. Sanford's objections raises the likelihood of a lawsuit that would delay the state's ability to use it.",

    "sentence": "Shooting staged as cover, police say. The wounding of a Columbia County woman charged in the beating death of a neighbor was staged to distract law enforcement, Richmond County investigators said Monday. Sheriff's Lt. Scott Peebles also said his department plans to submit its evidence to the district attorney for possible indictment. Authorities said Rebecca Sears, 41, of Grovetown, planned to have her son, Christopher Sean Bowers, 19, of Martinez, threaten her with a gun Thursday night as she left her job at Healing Hands Physical Therapy on Augusta's Highland Avenue. Ms. Sears was supposed to be on the phone with a co-worker at the time, according to sheriff's Sgt. Blaise Dresser. Instead, the son fired the gun, wounding his mother in the leg, Sgt. Dresser said. Ms. Sears told police a strange man appeared from the bushes as she left work, shot her in the leg, then said if she \"didn't have his money it would be her face,\" according to a Richmond County sheriff's report. \"She wasn't real happy about getting shot,\" Sgt. Dresser said Monday. Ms. Sears and Mr. Bowers are now both charged with murder in the brutal beating of Katherine \"Kay\" Parsons, 41, who was Ms. Sears' neighbor on Hot Springs Drive, as well as a co-worker. Last week, authorities said Mrs. Parsons appeared to have interrupted a burglary at her home, but sources familiar with the investigation said they now believe burglary was not a motive in her death. So far police have refused to discuss what prompted the fatal beating. On Monday, both Ms. Sears, of 227 Hot Springs Drive, and Mr. Bowers, of the 4000 block of Briarwood Drive, faced Magistrate Judge Dale Jenereaux via videoconference to hear the charges against them. Although both are also charged with murder, conspiracy allegations might be withdrawn, the magistrate said. According to arrest warrants filed with the court, authorities allege that Ms. Sears and Mr. Bowers killed Mrs. Parsons between 6:50 a.m. and 7:30 a.m. Wednesday after she returned home from taking her son to school. A deputy was called to her home when a contractor discovered a smashed-in door, and found Mrs. Parsons lying in the garage near a baseball bat and claw hammer believed to have been used in the attack.

Shashawna Diane Odell, 27, of the 500 block of Lou Lane, was charged with robbery, tampering with evidence and hindering the apprehension/punishent of a criminal. She was held without bond Monday in the Columbia County Detention Center, according to jail records. Police said her boyfriend Christopher Grier, of the 700 block of Knox Road in Harlem, is suspected in the armed robbery Friday of two individuals in their Grovetown home. At first, police believed Mr. Grier committed the robbery, then kidnapped Ms. Odell and their 7-month-old son and made her drive him to Monroeville, Ala. An Amber Alert was issued for Ms. Odell and her son after she called her mother in Washington, D.C. The mother called police, saying her daughter had been kidnapped, said Investigator Scott Wheatley of the Grovetown Department of Public Safety. Police found Ms. Odell and stopped her in Newton County, Ga. After they confirmed that she and the baby were safe, Ms. Odell drove back to Harlem on Sunday. Grovetown police then questioned Ms. Odell, who admitted that she willingly drove Mr. Grier to Alabama. She also told police that she drove the getaway car for Mr. Grier as he conducted the robbery and disposed of the gun he used, Investigator Wheatley said. The gun was recovered on Kings Way in Harlem. Mr. Grier is wanted for the robbery, but the kidnapping warrants have been dropped, Columbia County sheriff's Capt. Steve Morris said.",

    "sentence": "Statewide 211 could reach more poor. ATLANTA - Regional 2-1-1, a dialing code linking needy Georgia residents with everything from food pantries to social services, could begin expanding statewide by the end of the year, United Way officials said. If approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission, the expansion would stretch the service to 69 currently unserved counties. Those include several rural counties, among the hardest-hit by foreclosure and unemployment in the state. \"You want folks to be able to have access to information that helps them address basic needs - and you want them to be able to access that information wherever they live in the state,\" said Milton J. Little Jr., president of United Way of Metropolitan Atlanta, which initiated the exchange in 1997 and is leading efforts to expand statewide. United Way officials hope to submit a proposal to the commission by the end of the year. Right now, 2-1-1 callers are connected with operators at one of 11 call centers serving metropolitan regions across the state. Callers explain their needs to operators - anything from shelter after a weather catastrophe to rental assistance - who refer them to area service agencies. Organizers say the idea is to help people navigate the complex and ever-growing network of programs. It helps the needy in the most heavily populated areas of Georgia. But United Way officials have lacked the funds to expand to farther-flung areas, Little said. For them, \"resources as critical as emergency financial help to as general as where do I find a place to send my aging parents - they just don't have access,\" Little said. Expansion plans coincide with an increase in calls to the line. Operators fielded more than 370,000 calls in 2008, up from more than 336,000 in 2007. Little said some calls this time last year were for post-tornado help in the region. \"A lot of those callers now are bringing up issues related to food, clothing and shelter,\" said Little, who recently estimated 41.5 percent of Atlanta-area calls are for help with day-to-day expenses. Other states have been pushing to expand the program which United Way estimates connects 234 million people with social services. There are 29 states with full coverage, according to Linda Daily, director for 2-1-1 at United Way of America. They include Texas, where state funds cover 80 percent of the program's budget, she said. But many states are grappling with heavy shortfalls, and Daily acknowledged funding 2-1-1 could be a challenge. \"The budget is the main hurdle,\" she said, adding national United Way officials have lobbied Congress for help nationalizing the 2-1-1 program. Pending federal legislation could set aside $150 million in state 2-1-1 grant money for fiscal years 2010 and 2011, and $100 million for each of fiscal years 2012 through 2015. Versions of the bill are in committee in both the House and Senate. In Georgia, a coalition of United Way agencies led by the Atlanta agency will draft a plan that outlines how to fund the expansion, including possible use of state money. It will have to be approved by the commission and later, state lawmakers.",

    "sentence": "Scandal-plagued Ga. pastor to be buried Saturday. ATLANTA - A former mega church leader who rose to fame with his progressive evangelical ministry only to have it crumble after a series of sex scandals will be honored in the church he helped build in suburban Atlanta. Archbishop Earl Paulk of the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit at Chapel Hill Harvester Church died Sunday after a battle with cancer. He was 81. A funeral is scheduled for 1 p.m. Saturday at the Cathedral in Decatur. For years the church was at the forefront of many social movements - admitting black members in the 1960s, ordaining women and opening its doors to gays. But Paulk was dogged for decades by accusations of molestation and sexual misconduct. The most shocking revelation came in October 2007 when a court-ordered paternity test showed he was the biological father of his brother's son, D.E. Paulk, who had become head pastor of the church after the archbishop retired the previous year. Earl Paulk had sworn in an affidavit he'd never had sex with anyone but his wife, which lead to him pleading guilty to a felony charge of lying under oath. He was sentenced to 10 years' probation and a $1,000 fine. None of the Paulks could be reached for comment by The Associated Press, but D.E. Paulk issued a statement. \"Over the past 55 years, Bishop Paulk has ministered to thousands in the Atlanta area and touched the lives of countless thousands in the global community,\" he wrote. \"As the family and church mourn his death and celebrate his life, we pray for peace and closure for all who have been connected in any way to his life and ministry.\" Paulk's church, which he co-founded with his brother, Don, grew from a tiny congregation in the 1960s to a massive empire with 10,000 members, an international television ministry, a Bible college and a $12 million sanctuary on an expansive 100-acre plot in Decatur. Paulk was invited to a White House prayer breakfast by then-President Ronald Reagan, and the church was named one of former President George Bush's \"1,000 Points of Light.\" The church made national headlines in 1992 when six female members came forward saying they were brainwashed into having sexual relationships with Earl Paulk and Don Paulk and other ministers at the church. A decade later, a former church member accused Earl Paulk of molesting her when she was a child and teenager, a lawsuit that eventually was settled out of court. Then former church employee Mona Brewer sued Earl Paulk and the church, saying she had been coerced into having a long-term affair with the pastor because he told her it was her godly duty. It was her lawsuit that led to the paternity test and the felony charge. At the same time, Earl Paulk was battling prostate cancer and undergoing multiple surgeries that left him weak and unable to make much more than one appearance at the church each week. The church's membership dwindled to 1,000 - mostly due to the sexual scandals - and the flashy neo-Gothic cathedral is up for sale for $24.5 million. The church is seeking to move to a smaller venue and continue its ministry, D.E. Paulk has said. Don Paulk told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he hopes his brother will be remembered for his work in ministry rather than the scandals. \"Preachers are just like anyone else - they're a man,\" he told the newspaper.",

    "sentence": "Region 1 BOE approves proposed budget. FALLS VILLAGE—The Region 1 Board of Education moved quickly at its Monday night meeting to approve a proposed budget for the 2009-10 fiscal year reflecting a 1.99 percent increase in spending, a decision precipitated by several revisions and budgetary workshops. However, several members of the public took issue with the budget’s elimination of a custodial position and scheduling adjustment for the custodial staff. “A lot of you people just don’t realize what goes on in this building on a day-to-day basis,” said Pete Peterson. The budget removes one position from the daytime staff of two and a half positions and transfers one of the former daytime custodians to the night shift for a total of five staff members focusing on cleaning. Peterson, who fills the half position during the day, outlined his routine responsibilities, which include cleaning the locker rooms, kitchen and cafeteria, along with performing athletic field maintenance, in addition to emergencies and repairs. On Monday, when one of the hallways flooded, Mr. Peterson was forced to tend to the situation. He stressed that if the same situation were to occur with only two custodians in the building, certain responsibilities, such as lining the fields, would fall through the cracks. With spring clean close at hand and fall cleanup looming in the future, paring down the daytime staffing creates a daunting picture for Peterson. “I understand the fiscal ramifications of a budget, but I think the personnel aspect is overlooked,” said Mary Wheeler, a teacher whose husband is a custodian. Speaking on behalf of her husband, who also spoke at the meeting, she explained that her family relies on the dynamic of two parents being at home during the evening hours. Wheeler is set to move from the daytime shift to working from 3 to 11 p.m. As a teacher, Wheeler recognized the board’s duty to the taxpayers, but she emphasized the unfairness of significantly altering a 17-year employee’s schedule without consulting him. Though the board approved the budget with a majority vote, member Gale Toensing voiced her concern with the cuts and changes to the custodial staff. “I don’t buy into this doing more with less,” she said. She added that the board could not ignore what she characterized as substantial objections from the members of the community to the proposed reductions. The 1.99 percent increase brings the budget’s total to $14,149,238. Business Manager Sam Herrick continues to negotiate for a lower health care insurance renewal rate with Anthem Blue Cross, which produced the largest increase in the budget due last year’s high claim rate. The current rate is 23.63 percent higher. Board chairman Judge Manning also reported on the recent Personnel Committee’s “reluctant acceptance” of a salary freeze for Superintendent Patricia Chamberlain, per her request. During the budget process, both Herrick and high school principal Gretchen Foster also offered to forego their raises. However, Chamberlain vetoed that suggestion. With the proposed budget set, member towns’ contributions to Region 1 will be impacted in various degrees. Only Cornwall and Kent will see decreases, of $119,624 and $42,474 for a total of $1,409,257 and $2,552,999, respectively. Canaan will experience the highest jump, of $223,569, to a total of $3,440,885. Salisbury will face the second largest increase, of $138,429, for a total of $3,040,398. Sharon and Falls Village would see increases of $40,995 and $35,377, for totals of $2,718,708 and $986,989, respectively. Manning and Herrick visited residents in Sharon, Cornwall and Salisbury, members of Kent’s Board of Finance attended previous workshops and a meeting with the Canaan Board of Finance is scheduled for this week, thus ensuring that the Region 1 Board reviews the 1.99 percent increase directly with the member towns. Manning reported the budget has been positively received. Peterson, however, retained his doubts after the vote. “They’re cutting us way, way short,” he said. Before it takes effect, the proposed budget must be approved in a district-wide budget meeting. It is scheduled for March 31 at 7 p.m.",

    "sentence": "Connecticut lawmakers consider apologizing for slavery. HARTFORD — Connecticut legislators are considering making their state the first in New England to apologize for slavery and other racist policies of old. A legislative committee heard testimony Monday on a resolution that would issue a formal, general apology and express the General Assembly's \"profound contrition\" for the official acts that sanctioned and perpetuated slavery hundreds of years ago. The state's African-American Affairs Commission, a liaison between black communities and the government, is urging legislators to pass the resolution, which it has called \"an exercise in reconciliation\" and not an effort to determine fault for slavery. The commission's legislative analyst, Frank Sykes, told the legislature's Government Administration and Elections Committee that \"opportunities like this must be seized,\" especially in light of the \"giant stride\" the country took last November in electing its first black president, Barack Obama. \"While this is encouraging,\" Sykes said, \"it should inspire us and challenge us to continue peeling away at the layers of racial discrimination and intolerance. \"New Jersey last year became the first Northern state to apologize for slavery, and at least five other states have done so. Of Connecticut's population of 3.5 million people, about 10 percent are black, according to U.S. Census estimates for 2007. John A. Stewart, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Hartford, said he believes the differences between blacks and whites in the state stem from Connecticut's participation in slavery. Among full-time workers in the state, black men earn 70 percent of what white men earn. Black men in the state also are four times more likely than white men to live below the federal poverty line, and black children under 5 are seven times more likely than white children to live in poverty, Stewart said, citing U.S. Census data. \"Slavery has left a cultural burden on both the exploited and the exploiters that still permeates our society,\" Stewart said. The resolution says slavery was practiced in Connecticut from the 17th through 19th centuries. There were about 5,100 slaves in the colony by the mid-1770s, about 3 percent of the population at the time. In 1723, the colony passed an act creating a 9 p.m. curfew for slaves to prevent what it called the \"Disorder of Negro and Indian Servants and Slaves in the Night Season.\" Violation of the curfew was punishable by a whipping for the servant and a fine for the master. The resolution mentions how Connecticut's wealth grew as merchants participated in the Triangle Trade, which carried slaves, crops and goods among West Africa, the Caribbean and America. It also mentions how Connecticut legislators rejected emancipation bills in 1777, 1779 and 1780 and how the new state Constitution in 1818 specifically denied the right of blacks to vote. But it later mentions how Connecticut changed its ways and played a key role in abolition efforts, culminating in the outlawing of slavery in 1848. The resolution would need to be voted on by the Government Administration and Elections Committee, possibly next week, before going to the House of Representatives and then the Senate.",

TORRINGTON — City Council tentatively approved several budget changes during a meeting Wednesday, that would affect recycling and winter maintenance supplies for the 2009-10 fiscal year. Mayor Ryan Bingham proposed a reduction of $150,000 in a disposal line item, putting the funds at $1 million. Jerry Rollett, city engineer, noted that was the cost of savings from the city’s decision to switch to single-stream recycling. Last week the council unanimously approved the switch to the new system, which would allow residents to combine recyclables in the same bin. The vote came with an approval to utilize USA Hauling and Recycling Inc.Along with accepting the new company, the refuse contract line item jumped from $893,000 to $1.77 million. The reason for the hike was due to the contract with USA Hauling, which was numbered at $2.06 million for the year. A combination of other line items made up for the remainder of the contract prices, he said.",

    "sentence": "18 residents left homless after blaze. TORRINGTON — A fire destroyed the roof of a Main Street multi-family home Tuesday, displacing the tenants and injuring some firefighters. No residents were injured. The Torrington Fire Department responded to the call of a kitchen fire around 12:30 p.m. at 775 Main St., near the intersection of Dawes Street. What initially appeared under control progressively worsened, beginning with some smoke and resulting in flames and full-brown clouds emerging from the house, officials said. A total of 18 people live in the six-apartment building, and all evacuated safely, building owner Buzz Ebner said. Firefighters battled the incident throughout the entire afternoon and were on the scene as late as 10:30 p.m. Fire Marshal Tim Tharau said the department continued to put water on the structure after 8 p.m.A rehab station was set up outside of the house for firefighters to recuperate and check their blood pressure, said Litchfield Fire Chief Jim Koser. A few firefighters sustained minor injuries, but nothing too major occurred, Tharau said. An investigation determined that the incident began in the second-floor area of the building and was caused by a kitchen stove fire, Tharau said. The fire was accidental, he said. The building separates a north and south wing through a thick concrete wall in the middle, Ebner said. Emergency access staircases are both in the back and the front, he said. The initial blaze could be seen from the sides and the rear of the house, on both the second- and third-floor levels. A cloud of brown smoke emerged in full droves and encapsulated the entire north end of the city for hours. By 6 p.m., the entire roof of the home collapsed and water was flowing down the sides of the house. Torrington firefighters called in several other companies to assist including Harwinton, Bantam, Litchfield, Winsted and all Torrington volunteer departments. Several fire engines came and went during the incident and emergency medical services, city police and hazardous material trucks were also on the scene. Residents walked down from as far as the local McDonald’s to witness the commotion. During several points throughout the day spectators stopped to take pictures and watch as firefighters descended into a blaze of smoke on top of the roof. Some even watched from across the Naugatuck River in the Shop Rite parking lot. Jay Keefe, who lives down the street, said he heard the sirens of the trucks come by. When he looked out his window, he saw the smoke emerge from the three-story home. Due to the increasing smoke and the need to bring in more assistance, police and firefighters continuously pushed back the large mass of spectators, placing yellow caution tape along the side roads. At points traffic was detoured from as far down as Lois Street and nearby pedestrians were prohibited from getting too close to the action. Following the devastation, Red Cross in Waterbury provided shelter for the residents of the house, Ebner said. The building was equipped with fire insurance and some of the residents had fire insurance as part of their rent package, he said. Evan Heller, assistant fire weather program leader for the Albany-based National Weather Service, said the weather conditions on Tuesday had fire hazard potential — particularly the dry air and low humidity. “Wind is a factor,” Heller said. “The stronger the wind the higher the potential.” The early spring is considered “fire weather season,” he said, after the snow melts but before the leaves begin to grow again. “This is the time that things can dry out,” Heller said. “Usually once you leaf out, by early summer, usually that risk tends to go down.” Several other fires occurred throughout the state Tuesday, including a brush fire on Center Street in Torrington, fires in Weston and a forest fire in Glastonbury. Torrington firefighters continued to work at 775 Main St., checking for and extinguishing hot spots, Torrington firefighter Edward DeLisle said Tuesday around 10 p.m. A section of Main Street still remained closed at that hour, he said.",

But town and state police were able to gain entry to the Plancons’ trade and make multiple purchases of narcotics from them, police said. Police believe the Plancons were buying the narcotics in New Haven and then selling them to a network of Shoreline customers. Police characterized it as a fairly small operation.

Shingleton explained that he hoped to piggyback the purchase of the bathroom with a similar project in another town — Oakdale — thereby reducing the overall cost. In all, Shingleton told the board, he expects the bathroom to cost $47,837. Director of Public Works Eric Hood said the town is purchasing the prefabricated bathroom from United Concrete Products of Wallingford. \"We’re trying to keep it in state,\" he told the selectmen. The bathroom will contain one men’s bathroom and one women’s bathroom and a storage closet in between, Hood said. Construction of the park has been a priority since Shingleton took office in November 2007. In addition to installing the restrooms, Shingleton told the selectmen crews still must complete installation of a series of trails and bocce courts at the park. That, he said, will complete the first phase of the park construction. That will be followed by a second phase, which includes installation of a pavilion. \"Once we have the pavilion in place, we have a park,\" he said. And when the work is completed, \"That will be a great picnic area,\" Shingleton added. But, he acknowledged, without the restrooms, picnickers \"can’t stay there for a long time. \"Sylvester, the finance director, said town policy allows bid waivers if state or federal contract awards are being used or if the town is participating in a multi-town purchasing arrangement. Shingleton sought the waiver to take advantage of \"bid pricing obtained by another town,\" Sylvester explained.",

Instead, they say, that was just the beginning of an unfolding incident at an apartment house on Nordland Avenue. Shortly after 7 a.m., police received a complaint from a tenant about loud music, which “was disrupting his peace,” coming from another apartment, Capt. Roy A. Nelson said. An officer responded and “he could hear the music from a couple of houses away,” Nelson said. However, when the officer went to the apartment from where the music was coming, Nelson said the tenant, Brian O’Connor, 38, of 20E Nordland Ave., “was cooperative and agreed to turn down the music.” With that, the officer left, the captain said. But at 8:12 a.m., police were summoned back to the same address by a frantic call from a frightened tenant of the building. The woman told police that O’Connor had threatened her and had damaged her property — and that he had come into her apartment without being invited in. When police, including Sgt. Edwin Kosinski, arrived at the address in response to the call, they were told O’Connor had allegedly gone to another tenant’s apartment first. He banged on the door and allegedly accused the first tenant of having called police, Nelson said. However, that tenant was apparently able to convince O’Connor he had not called the police. So, police said, O’Connor moved on to another apartment. There, he allegedly damaged the woman’s wind chime and then “made entry into her apartment.” Once inside, he allegedly called out, threatening the woman, police said. Frightened, “the woman hid until Mr. O’Connor left and then called police,” Nelson said. As police proceeded with their investigation, Sgt. Kosinski stopped a tenant and asked him if he was Brian O’Connor. The man replied he was not, at which point he began advancing on Kosinski, Nelson said. However, Officer Joe DiMaruo, who knew O’Connor, alerted Kosinski that the man he had questioned and who approached him was in fact O’Connor. Kosinski ordered the man to back away, and when he would not, Nelson said Kosinski subdued him with minimal force. O’Connor was placed under arrest; he was charged with breach of peace, threatening, attempt to commit third-degree burglary and interfering with a police officer. He was ordered held on $10,000 bond for a pending appearance in Middlesex Superior Court.",

    "sentence": "Ever-popular 'Mr Ice Cream' dies aged 72. CAMBRIDGE'S Mr Ice Cream, Antonio Savino, has died. Mr Savino, who was 72, was a familiar, cheerful face on the city's streets for 40 years, selling ice cream from his van on Chesterton Road, along the Backs, and at Cherry Hinton Hall. As he drove around, his van would chime the tune O Sole Mio, and his beaming smile will be remembered by thousands of people. He was born in the small village of Flumeri in southern Italy in 1936, and married the love of his life, Antonietta, in 1958. She had been living in England for four years, and the couple were both employed as domestics for a wealthy family at Kentford, near Newmarket. Later they moved to Cambridge and Mr Savino got a job at the Fitzwilliam Museum, also working as a kitchen porter. Being a tailor by trade, he took in work making and repairing suits for the Cambridge Italian community. In 1967, having saved enough money, he bought his first ice cream van and became one of the first vendors in Cambridge. In the early days his round would cover much of north Cambridge, including Arbury and Chesterton, then during the 1980s he was given a permit by the city council to have a fixed pitch at Garret Hostel Lane, along the Backs. A family spokeswoman said: \"Locals and tourists will have lovely memories of his infectious warmth and charming personality. \"He always seemed to have enough time to make his customers feel special, and a remarkable ability for remembering names as well as faces. \"We would like to thank everyone who has sent kind messages and letters since his death in Addenbrooke's Hospital a few days ago.\" His funeral will take place on Wednesday at 10am at the Church of Our Lady and The English Martyrs in Hills Road.",

Thirteen kind-hearted youngsters received awards from the High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire, Judy Pearson, for their exceptional contributions to communities across the county. Among those honoured include 17-year-olds Luke Slater and Daniel Stephen, who run a Saturday youth club for teenagers in Newmarket Road, Cambridge, called Parent Free Zone, and eight Newmarket Ranger guides who run activities for girls with special needs. Rebecca Rayner also picked up the High Sheriff Award for her tireless fundraising efforts and her work to mentor young cadets in the Huntingdon Sea Cadets. There were also awards for a leading member of the Fenzone youth council, Charlie Manders, and Robert McColl, who runs a bike repair training service in Peterborough. Mrs Pearson praised the actions of the civic-minded youngsters. \"These young people are shining lights in their communities,\" she said. \"Their selfless dedication to other people is most impressive. They have committed a huge amount of time to other people and I commend them for it.\" The awards were presented at St Ivo School, in St Ives, on Thursday, and were attended by the chief constable of Cambridgeshire police Julie Spence. The evening also saw the High Sheriff hand out more than £8,700 to a variety of youth projects, including a project run by Romsey Mill, in Mill Road, Cambridge, to involve young people in volunteering at Anglesey Abbey. There was also a cash grant for East Cambridgeshire Girl Guides to follow the lead of their Newmarket colleagues to provide guiding opportunities for girls with special needs. The St Ives Youth Theatre, which performed at the awards evening, also picked up a grant to help it stage a musical called Tom Sawyer. There were also awards for various youth, Guide and Scouting groups across the county. \"It is a great pleasure to be able to distribute the money raised this year to so many resourceful young people who are making a difference to the lives of other young and not-so-young people in Cambridgeshire,\" Mrs Pearson added. Other grant recipients include Romsey Mill's Aspire, the Huntingdon and District Sea Cadets, Cottenham Village College, West Cambridge Christian Youth Ministries, Parent Free Zone, the Connections Bus Project, 1st Caxton Brownies and Rainbows, Comberton Ten Sing, Ely Army Cadet Force, Orwell Youth Club and Waterbeach Action for Youth.",

The 67-year-old, who suffers from motor neurone disease and uses a voice synthesiser to speak, will tackle some of the great mysteries of the cosmos: how the universe began, how it will end, the likelihood of extra-terrestrial life and the possibility of time travel. Prof Hawking said: \"This ambitious series explores some of the most fascinating aspects of cosmology and I am pleased to bring these theories to a new audience. \"I hope these visions of the universe will evoke a sense of wonder for everyone, and maybe inspire a new generation of cosmologists.\" The series will use a combination of live action, archive footage, computer-generated images and special effects to bring Hawking's theories to life. Prof Hawking, Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University, has made huge contributions to the field of cosmology, and particularly the study of black holes, during his career - his best-selling book, A Brief History Of Time, brought the subject to a popular audience. John Ford, the Discovery Channel's president and general manager, said: \"We are breaking the mould of documentary film-making and storytelling in Stephen Hawking's Universe. Visualising the universe through one of the greatest minds on the planet is an incredibly challenging prospect.\" The series will comprise one two-hour and two one-hour shows, and is expected to be broadcast early next year.",

    "sentence": "Teacher credited with saving life. Though students can be grateful for educators for many different reasons, Cambridge High Schooler Trevor Wilkinson has a special reason to thank science teacher Cliff Hoak. \"I'd just want to say 'Thank you' to Mr. Hoak. He saved my life,\" said the 13-year-old seventh-grader. With Wilkinson choking on a rag and barely able to breath, Mr. Hoak used the Heimlich Maneuver to help dislodge the rag from the boy's throat. \"I was in fourth period. It was free day in ATP (achievement test practice),\" he said. \"I asked (teacher Jennifer Carpenter) if I could go get my math so I could work on it in the free time, because I had homework. I was chewing on this rag and I was walking up the stairs and when I got to the top of the stairs close to my locker, I went to get a breath from chewing ... and it sucked into my wind pipe. At first I was calm. But I started panicking once I started running out of breath.\" \"He was going out with his class when it happened,\" Wilkinson said. \"He saw me and I got just enough breath to say I couldn't breath. He did the Heimlich two or three times. He couldn't get anything to work, so he went over to (Mr. Hoak's class) and knocked on his door and Mr. Hoak came rushing out and did the Heimlich on me.\" Though Hoak's efforts did not expel the rag -- a piece of cloth used to clean electronic devices, such as cell phones, iPods and eyeglasses -- the boy was able to swallow it and clear his airway. \"I went to the doctor,\" Wilkinson said. \"They couldn't take an X-ray because it was cloth. She checked my lungs and said it was OK.\" He said the rag would either dissolve or pass through his digestive system, according to his pediatrician. Named for American physician Dr. Henry Jay Heimlich, the Heimlich Maneuver involves the use of abdominal thrusts inward and upward, expelling air and forcing out an object lodged in the airway. Eric Stevens, paramedic with United Ambulance Service, was on hand at the school Friday to demonstrate to teacher Lisa Taylor's health students some of the techniques emergency medical personnel use to establish and maintain an open airway for a choking victim. \"We started talking about severe burns and bleeding and we brought in choking due to the fact that there was a student in our school system that was choking,\" Taylor said. \"And when I asked the kids if anyone had any classes on this, maybe three of the 25 students raised their hand. So I thought this was good to bring it to our class and to at least be experienced with it. I'm very thankful that United Ambulance Service came on such short notice to show us the proper procedures on what to do.\" Middle school students are not eligible for certification in the use of the Heimlich Maneuver, though that is available to high schoolers. \"The kids around were concerned. The kids that were watching him ... they couldn't believe he was actually choking,\" she said. \"I think some kids were crying and really emotional. (Hoak) acted calmly and quickly and was able to handle the situation. We're really pleased to have teachers who know what to do in that type of situation.\" \"I was lucky I was in the right place at the right time,\" he said. \"Mr. Hoak was calm about it. Thanks, Mr. Hoak!\" Trevor Wilkinson is the son of Missy and Bill Wilkinson.",

At of the end of February there were 99 foreclosures pending in the court, 20 more than the same time in 2008. The number of child support cases pending through the first two months of 2008 totaled 14. During the same period in 2009 that number has more than doubled to 31. Common Pleas Judge David A. Ellwood said he believes the numbers will only grow. \"I would think that would have to follow as the economy and the recession worsen,\" he said. \"Foreclosures obviously follow the economy and if people don't have jobs they clearly won't be able to pay child support. So we're going to have more child support arrearage cases. And we work with people in both of those categories. But the court is dependent on whatever cases are filed. And that's the cases that are filed right now that are increasing.\" On a brighter note, criminal cases are down from 79 in January and February 2008 to 57 this year and there are currently no domestic violence cases in court, compared to three last year. \"Other civil\" cases -- those not categorized as professional torts, product liability or other torts -- dropped as well, from 103 last year to 76. \"But here's the 800-pound gorilla still in the room,\" Ellwood said of the foreclosures and child support cases. Total cases pending in the court's general division as of Feb. 28, with 2007 number in parenthesis, are as follows: Total cases pending in the court's domestic relations division as of Feb. 28, with 2007 number in parenthesis, are as follows: The Probation Department currently supervises 240, including 218 on basic probation, nine offenders on pretrial release, four on electronic monitored house arrest and nine drug court participants. Year-to-date statistics in other probation categories include one expungement, 34 home visits, 117 drug tests performed with 30 positive results, 22 arrests. Restitution for victims of crime collected through the end of February totaled $14,599.72. Ellwood said nine community service workers logged 238.75 hours in February, and 430.75 to date in 2009. Work sites include the Guernsey County Administration Building, Guernsey County Courthouse, dog warden and prosecutor's offices and the Noble Learning Center.",

    "sentence": "Ohio recession: Pay cuts, fewer police. MOUNT GILEAD (AP) -- A city court won't accept new cases because it's out of paper and has no money to reorder. Elsewhere, more firefighters are accepting wage decreases to save their jobs, and administrators at another state university are freezing their pay. Public entities around Ohio are hoping gestures like these will protect them from bigger problems caused by the recession. The gestures come when there's no relief in sight for battered Ohio, whose unemployment rate has hit 8.8 percent, a two-decade high. Tax revenue is flat at best or plunging at worst as layoffs continue and residents sew up their wallets and pocketbooks. In Mount Gilead, Judge Lee McClelland, of Morrow County Municipal Court in north-central Ohio, says the court has just enough paper to handle hearing notices and other documents for pending cases. He says several county agencies have volunteered to bring their own paper in to handle their filings. The court also is switching to a four-day work week to save money. In Euclid, in the northeast, firefighters agreed to a 2-percent pay cut and less money for continuing education and retirement funds for new firefighters in exchange for no layoffs. The city already has laid off 17 jail employees and is hoping to avoid police department layoffs. In Youngstown, Mayor Jay Williams wants city employees to work four fewer hours a week, equivalent to a 10 percent pay cut, to avoid layoffs. He's also taking a 10 percent cut, or about $10,500 in wages and benefits. Youngstown State University President David Sweet, who makes about $230,000 a year, said Friday he and eight top university officials will give up their 3 percent pay raises to create a new student financial aid fund. Earlier this month, Ohio State University said it would freeze the pay of President Gordon Gee and 18 members of his management team and put the money toward student scholarships. Top administrators at Wright State University will give up raises this year and contribute to an emergency relief fund for students. In Mansfield, Richland County Sheriff Steve Sheldon is scheduled to lay off 11 employees, though grant money saved an extra three jobs that were to be cut. The police union is proposing alternatives to layoffs, including eliminating part-time or seasonal jobs first. In Columbus, city firefighters agreed to a pay freeze to avoid layoffs. Police declined the offer and were about to lose 25 newly hired recruits when Mayor Michael Coleman announced $1.25 million in federal stimulus money would save their jobs for now. But small gestures won't work in every cash-strapped city. Toledo Mayor Carty Finkbeiner says he plans in May to lay off 75 police officers, about 12 percent of the division, if the city doesn't receive $35 million in federal stimulus funds.",

    "sentence": "Home hit by fire a second time. BYESVILLE -- Firefighters are searching for the cause of a blaze Monday morning that heavily damaged an Indian Lake Road residence approximately 14 months after a house at that same address was destroyed by fire. A spokesperson for the Byesville Volunteer Fire Department said the cause may be electrical, but the fire remains under investigation. The fire at the home of Rose Bench, 9025 Indian Lake Road, was first reported at approximately 8 a.m. It is believed to have started in the garage under the home. The Guernsey County Sheriff's Office reported receiving multiple 911 calls advising of the blaze. Neighbors were concerned Bench may have still been inside the home. A crew from United Ambulance was reportedly the first emergency responders to arrive on scene. \"The neighbors tried to get inside, but they were unable to open the door,\" said Steve Helton of United Ambulance. \"We went around and kicked in the back door, but the smoke was already almost to the floor. \"We got as low as possible and went inside where we were able to yell for anybody inside, but there was no response,\" added Helton, who is also a Cambridge firefighter, of the effort to locate Bench. Working with Helton was fellow United Ambulance employee and firefighter Ron Brokaw. A dispatcher with the sheriff's office located Bench a short time later at her place of employment. Firefighters launched an initial attack on the flames through the kitchen located above the garage and then through the garage until the flames were knocked down. Providing mutual aid at the scene were firefighters from the Cambridge, Pleasant City and Lore City departments. A search of the home was conducted once the flames were under control and a recovery effort was later launched to remove salvageable items from the home. In addition to the heavy fire damage, the house sustained extensive smoke and water damage. A 2006 Dodge Dakota truck parked in the garage was also heavily damaged. No firefighters were injured fighting the fire. Firefighters cleared the scene at approximately 10:30 a.m. In January 2008, a fire at a home at that same location destroyed the residence and injured a neighbor, who later succumbed to his injuries. Neighbors reported construction to replace the home had just recently finished. The American Red Cross Disaster Team responded to the scene to assist Bench, according to Caroline Johnson, chapter office manager. Sheetz in Cambridge also provided coffee and donuts for firefighters and emergency responders at the scene.",

    "sentence": "Special ed group criticizes Ohio governor's budget . COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Gov. Ted Strickland's budget proposal shortchanges special education by using a faulty funding formula, cutting vital programs and relying too heavily on one-time federal stimulus money, advocates said. Strickland's education funding model doesn't account for the cost of additional teacher time needed to instruct children with learning disabilities, the Ohio Coalition for the Education of Children with Disabilities said in a letter sent Monday to the Strickland administration and state lawmakers. Strickland's two-year budget proposal cuts all budget earmarks — including a $1.5 million program to mentor parents of special needs students. It replaces a significant share of the state's funding responsibility for special education with federal economic stimulus money, an apparent violation of federal mandates that would require a waiver, said coalition Executive Director Margaret Burley. \"I'm still puzzled,\" Burley said Friday. \"There seems to be a big emphasis on early childhood learning but not for children with disabilities.\" The Strickland administration has acknowledged that the funding formula is a problem that needs to be resolved. \"Quite frankly, we believe this is a valid criticism of the proposal,\" said John Stanford, Strickland's education adviser. \"We are still in conversation with the coalition about the issue.\" Both Burley and state Rep. Ron Amstutz, the ranking Republican on the House Finance and Appropriations Committee, said it has been difficult to get information about the school funding formula from the Strickland administration. \"People are allowed to make mistakes. We just want them to get corrected,\" said Burley, who's optimistic the formula will be revised. The state is spending $470.5 million in the fiscal year ending in June on special education funding — all state money. Strickland has proposed an increase of $56 million for the next fiscal year, but the state's share of the funding would drop to 58 percent because of the federal stimulus money. This would appear to require a waiver from the federal government because the state is generally required to maintain its funding for special education, Amstutz and Burley said. Stanford said the federal government has not yet given clearance for the state's proposed use of stimulus money. \"We will continue to work with the U.S. Department of Education to make sure that the program that we have developed in the state of Ohio is compliant with all federal rules,\" he said. Advocates and Republican lawmakers are also concerned that the reliance on federal money would create funding gaps in the future. \"I think we owe it to them to look further than the next meal of federal funds because we don't have any reason to expect that to continue,\" said Amstutz, of Wooster. Burley said the special education community also continues to be upset about what has been a longtime defect in allocating money to programs. The funding model assumes a base teacher salary for preschool special education of $17,500 — the figure that was pertinent in 1989. Strickland's new \"evidence-based\" funding model for all education assumes an average teacher salary of about $45,000. Burley said the lagging salary number for preschool special education has decreased the share of state spending over time, forcing local districts to make up the difference. \"Preschool kids are where we can make the most gains,\" Burley said. \"The evidence shows they are ready to learn and we have to give them the building blocks they need to continue their education.\"",

    "sentence": "Killer asks Ohio court to delay execution . A convicted killer scheduled to die next month has asked the Ohio Supreme Court to delay his execution, alleging that a jailhouse informant committed perjury. Brett Hartmann said a motion filed Friday that he needs time to gather evidence of the alleged perjury and test other evidence he says will prove his innocence. The motion also asks the court to delay the execution to allow Hartmann time to demonstrate that Ohio's method of lethal injection is unconstitutional. He has said that it would deny him a quick and painless death as required by state law. The state Supreme Court this month denied an earlier request by Hartmann to delay his execution so he could challenge the state's execution method. Hartmann had asked for that stay to allow time for him to join a lawsuit pending in Franklin County that makes a similar challenge. Hartmann is scheduled to die April 7 for the fatal stabbing and mutilation of 46-year-old Wanda Snipes in Akron on Sept. 9, 1997. Documents and legal filings in the case refer to the inmate as Hartman, but he has said his name is Hartmann. The filing Friday said the state has repeatedly referred to the informant's testimony as critical evidence of Hartmann's guilt. The new evidence severely undermines the informant's credibility and casts doubt on the validity of the conviction, Hartmann's motion said. His motion also referred to testimony presented March 23 in a federal trial in Ohio that is part of another condemned inmate's challenge to the lethal injection process. The judge in the federal case is taking testimony from Ohio's execution team to determine whether condemned killer Kenneth Biros can prove he has a chance of making a successful argument against injection in a longer and more detailed trial. Hartmann's motion said testimony given in the federal court case provided evidence to demonstrate that Ohio's execution method carries \"substantial risk of harm, i.e. excruciating pain during the execution.\" It would be \"particularly unfair and inhumane\" to execute Hartmann within days of the first time that testimony became available to him and to the public, Hartmann's motion said. Hartmann has said he must be given the same opportunity as other death row inmates to challenge the constitutionality of Ohio's execution method.",

COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Economic development officials in Ohio say they will check whether Wal-Mart Stores Inc. violated terms of a tax agreement by closing an optical lab near Columbus. Ohio gave the world's largest retailer a $1.8 million job-creation tax credit in 2001 on the condition that the company create and maintain jobs there. Wal-Mart on Friday announced that it will close the lab, cutting 650 jobs. The lab makes eyewear for vision centers in Wal-Mart stores. Kelly Schlissberg, a spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Development, says the agency is reviewing its agreement with Wal-Mart to determine if the state can recoup money. A message seeking comment was left Saturday for a Wal-Mart spokesman.",

    "sentence": "Taxing cow flatulence? It could happen if emission fees approved. That's what two Republican state lawmakers fear will happen if federal officials move forward with plans to charge fees to farmers for livestock emissions. Sens. Tim Grendell, from Chesterland, and Bob Gibbs, from Lakeville, have introduced a resolution in the Ohio Senate urging quick passage of federal legislation exempting livestock from Clean Air Act fees. The resolution stems from a 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision that ruled greenhouse gases are considered pollutants under the Clean Air Act. As such, entities with emissions of more than 100 tons per year would have to obtain the proper permits. It would take 25 dairy cows, 50 beef cattle, 200 hogs or 200 sheep to produce that amount of emissions, Grendell said. The two lawmakers, citing statistics compiled by the American Farm Bureau Federation, said the resulting Clean Air fees on livestock producers would range from $22 a head for hogs to $175 per head for dairy cows. \"I believe everyone understood those gases to be industrial gases and not gases produced by livestock,\" Grendell told reporters Wednesday. \"And in fact I would submit that before we should put a tax on gas produced by livestock, we would have to impose a tax on those who use Taco Bell.\" Their resolution, a symbolic gesture showing the state's stance on the issue, urges the Environmental Protection Agency not to implement new regulations on livestock producers, nor impose new fees on farmers for animals' emissions. \"The Clean Air Act was adopted to regulate and prevent air pollution from smokestack industries,\" Gibbs later testified before the Senate's natural resources committee.",

We're starting over again up there. We're starting very slowly, to get our feet on the ground.\" Sohovich owns Soho's in Capitol Market and Blossom Deli downtown.

It is in the former Smokey Bones location near Olive Garden. \"What we're doing now is, we're going to keep some of the old and bring some new in,\" Sohovich said. \"We'll broaden our menu. We have trout, oysters Rockefeller and some fillets. We've kept some of the Billy's favorites - chicken and dumplings, meatloaf and ribs. \"Every day we're adding new menu items,\" he said. \"By the middle of next week we should have everything we're going to serve on the menu available. We want to take it one day, one step at a time, and make sure our feet are firmly planted on the ground.\" \"We got away from lunch,\" he said. \"We're going to concentrate on the dinner entree business and the sports bar aspect. We have a full bar and an upgraded wine list.\" The restaurant is open from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Friday, noon to 10 p.m. Saturday; and noon to 9 p.m. Sunday. \"Absolutely great people who worked there before are in there now helping me,\" Sohovich said. He praised his bankers, United Bank Charleston Market President Julie Gurtis and her assistant, David Mills, as well as his Southridge landlord, Lee Rashid. \"These people have made it possible with the financing, the rent - they've given me the opportunity to get this restaurant back up and running,\" Sohovich said. \"They're truly trying to help me put everything back together. \"Every one of the purveyors has been a gentleman and has been working with me,\" he added. \"I could have taken Billy's into bankruptcy.

SOUTH CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- Photographs of artifacts taken from the Creel Burial Mound in South Charleston now have a permanent home at the new Mound Interpretive Center next to the LaBelle Theater in South Charleston. The new center will open to the public at 11 a.m. today after nearly five years of work and research by South Charleston officials and community leaders. \"Joe Mays was on city council and did the ground work to get this going,\" said Ben Paul, chairman of the center committee. The completion of the center was made possible through a $300,000-plus grant from the West Virginia Division of Highways, and the city added $80,000. The city-owned building was renovated by the public works department and designed by designminds, which planned and created the interpretive displays in the center. Along with the mound display and Native American artifacts, a portion of the center is devoted to the Midland Trail. Alice Hypes, executive director of the Midland Trail National Scenic Highway, represents the 180 miles of the trail in West Virginia. \"We're very excited about the exhibit,\" she said. \"Folks that come into the center can push a button and find out about the whole trail, which is one of the oldest in the country.\" In fact, Hypes said George Washington designed the original trail from Virginia Beach, Va., to Cedar Grove in 1790. Visitors to the center can discover the interesting points along the trail from Cabell County to Bluefield by selecting one of nine buttons that initiates an audio interpretation of a specific area along the trail. In addition to the Mound and Midland Trail sections of the center, there are displays of Blenko Glass and items from Union Carbide when it was in its heyday. The mound portion of the center focuses on the Adena Culture that built the mounds in the area. At one time there were more than 50 earthen mounds built by these Native Americans in our area from St. Albans to Kanawha City. Today, only three remain. One is located behind Sunset Memorial Park in South Charleston while another is at Shawnee Park in Institute. The largest remaining one is the South Charleston Mound, which is estimated to have been built between 250 and 100 B.C. \"This is the first time in 125 years that people can see what artifacts were discovered in the mound,\" said Mayor Mullins. \"We hope this center provides the public with a good image of the history of our area.\" Mullins also said he wants school groups to be a part of the center's programs by visiting and taking part in activities planned for the future. \"We want this center to be open to all, from individuals to schools, seniors, church groups and college students,\" he said. \"We hope that anyone who's interested in the history of the area will find the center exciting, enjoyable and educational.\" A large relief map of the three mounds still in the Kanawha Valley along with a wall map marked to indicate their location is also audio equipped. The display also shows a half-portion of a mound where visitors to the center can see what the Adena people buried in their mounds. A back hallway of the center is lined with pictures of the artifacts excavated in the 1800s by the Smithsonian Institution. Darla Spencer, a member of the West Virginia Council for Archaeology as well as the Native American History Council, took the pictures. The photos show necklaces of ocean shells that were made by the Adena people and fish darts, arrowheads, mussel shells, projectile points, stone disks and more. The Adena people were the first in this region to settle down in small villages, cultivate crops, use pottery vessels, acquire exotic raw materials, such as copper and marine shells to make ornaments and jewelry and to bury their honored dead in burial mounds. The period of the Adena's existence is estimated from 500 BC to 1000 AD. Mary Ann Wade and Gloria Shirkey will be operating the center and be available to answer any questions visitors might have. \"At least we hope so,\" said Wade. \"We also have a video or sound library of 13 CDs of historical artifacts of the city of South Charleston that we can play for visitors too.\" When the center opens Friday, there will be a group of school children from South Charleston among the first visitors. \"We hope that kids will utilize the center at every opportunity,\" said Mayor Mullins. \"It's the community's place now and we hope folks will visit often.\" The Mound Interpretive Center is on D Street in South Charleston and will be open to the public from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday and from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday.",

Charleston police were called Tuesday to a report of a disturbance at the Knights Inn motel on MacCorkle Avenue in Kanawha City. A man there, identified as Rick Smith, told police he'd been trying to break up a fight between Jason Terrell Jones, 23, of Central Avenue and Jones' girlfriend, who was not identified, according to a complaint filed in Kanawha Magistrate Court. Witnesses told police Jones got upset, went into the motel room where he was staying, retrieved a gun and put it to Smith's head, the complaint said. Jones fled on foot when officers arrived but was picked up a short distance away, according to the complaint. Police wrote in the complaint that they found a gun in a creek bed along the route Jones took to evade arrest. While searching Jones at police headquarters, officers retrieved two baggies of white rocks, believed to be crack cocaine, from Jones' underwear, the complaint said. The substance in the bags, which totaled about 8.6 grams, later tested positive as cocaine, according to the complaint. Police discovered that Jones had been convicted in 2004 of selling controlled substances in Bronx County, N.Y, which makes him ineligible to possess a gun, the complaint said. Jones was charged with brandishing, possessing a firearm when prohibited by law and possession of crack cocaine with intent to deliver.",

    "sentence": "New policy restricts some transfer students from playing high school sports. Kanawha County high school students will have to sit out a year of sports if they transfer from one county school to another after the start of their ninth grade year, school board members decided. At a tense and combative meeting Thursday night, the board approved the plan aimed at eliminating the recruiting of high school athletes. Board members say behavior by some coaches, boosters and parents are ruining community schools, promoting unsportsmanlike conduct and overshadowing academics. School officials are trying to correct what they said was a loophole in country policy. To get around a yearlong sports ban that applied to students who transferred from one school district to another, parents were renting apartments, moving into other family members' homes or changing custody of their children to prove they had \"moved.\" That exempted the students from the ban. After Thursday's vote, any Kanawha County student who switches high schools after the start of their ninth-grade year, for any reason, can't play sports for a year. The last chance to transfer without facing the ban is as an incoming freshman, right out of middle school. Board members signed off on the change with the caveat that they might soon consider additional restrictions, including requiring transfer students to keep a higher grade point average to play sports. The board had voted down a more stringent transfer policy earlier Thursday. That proposal would have barred any student in middle school and high school from playing sports for a year if he or she either changed schools or started as a new student in the county. It would have applied even to students who moved with their families from another county or state. Steve Hurley told the board he was recently laid off from his job at American Woodmark. He said he planned to move from Grant County to Nitro with his family to find work. \"And now, all of the sudden, the kids don't want to move because they want to play sports,\" he said. \"We're trying to move four hours to better our family and the school system says, 'No, you can't do that,'\" Hurley said. Board members Jim Crawford and Bill Raglin voted for that stricter policy. But board president Becky Jordon and board members Pete Thaw and Robin Rector voted it down. Jordon then attempted to build consensus for the compromise plan. In a 3-2 vote, the board approved the less strict policy change. Crawford and Raglin voted against it, saying it was not strong enough. Raglin specifically argued that the final policy still has too much potential for loopholes. He said students are being recruited and lured to schools to play sports and provide entertainment for fans, and then they are abandoned academically. \"I'm here to represent the concerns of the students whose parents aren't concerned,\" Raglin said. He said data given to him by Superintendent Ron Duerring show that high school athletes who transfer schools perform worse academically than other transfer students. Raglin suggested requiring a GPA of 2.5 or above for student athletes who transfer from one county school to another. The current GPA requirement is 2.0 for all student athletes. \"A 2.0 GPA guarantees one thing: consideration for a job, maybe at McDonald's,\" he said. But Kackie Eller, a guidance counselor at George Washington High School, said some of the proposed restrictions could spell \"the end of school sports as we know them.\" She said students are increasingly turning to athletic programs outside of school, especially church league basketball, to avoid confusing eligibility rules now in place. Eller raised concern that some of the proposed policy changes would punish many students because of the actions of the few. \"I don't understand why they can't just come down on the coaches,\" she said. \"The failure of this system has been our failure,\" Thaw said. \"We've allowed the overzealous coaches. We've allowed the indiscriminate boosters.\" Several board members suggested that whatever policy they adopted, they would be willing to hear appeals and grant exceptions in some cases.",

    "sentence": "South Charleston to get carbon capture pilot plant. The Dow Chemical Co. announced that French engineering company Alstom will build a pilot plant to capture carbon dioxide from the flue gas at Dow's coal-fired power plant in South Charleston. The companies said Alstom will design, construct and operate the pilot plant and Dow will provide the site, the utilities and the chemicals. The plant will use amine technology jointly developed by Alstom and Dow. Amines are organic compounds. Gov. Joe Manchin said, \"We're tickled to death they're coming here. This is research that we think has an awful lot of promise. If we could retrofit coal-fired plants, what a break that is. \"It seems that chemists have found things that can drop carbon out of the stack. We think this could be the key that unlocks the future of how we'll be able to deal with the carbon that's coming off of existing coal-fired power plants.\" Jim Guidarini, Dow's West Virginia site leader, said the South Charleston power plant has the only coal-fired boiler owned by Dow Chemical in the United States. The power plant has three boilers -- two that burn natural gas and one that burns coal. The pilot plant will test the Alstom-Dow amine carbon capture process on the coal-fired boiler's flue gas. Work on the pad for the pilot plant began several weeks ago, Guidarini said. About 20 construction workers will be on site at the height of construction. \"We expect construction to be done in another couple of months,\" he said. The plant is expected to begin operating by the third quarter of this year. Alstom then will have five people on site to operate it. \"We expect it to run for two years,\" Guidarini said. \"It depends on what we learn. That's why we're doing a pilot -- to learn things.\" Asked about the plant's price tag, Guidarini said, \"We're not releasing any cost information on it.\" \"The way the amine process works is, you scrub the carbon dioxide out of the vent stream with the amines,\" Guidarini said. \"You have a reactive product. Then you get the carbon dioxide off and you have pure carbon dioxide. The idea going forward in large plants is, you sequester the carbon dioxide somehow. In this plant we're just testing the first piece -- how do you capture the carbon dioxide, how do you get it off the amines?\" The carbon dioxide that is captured will be released, he said. \"The problem with carbon dioxide is, it's tough to use,\" said. \"It's not very reactive. It's a hard feedstock to do anything with. You don't hear of anybody doing anything with carbon dioxide because it's tough to do. But that's something Dow in the future is certainly looking at.\" Manchin said, \"The money will be in the research to figure out what you do with the carbon. It's like when we burned coal and had refuse piles. Then they captured sulfur with a limestone spray and had another byproduct. Now they're using that byproduct to make gypsum board. There's got to be a way to solidify carbon and use it for fuel.\" The cost of removing carbon dioxide is considered an energy loss, since the energy needed for the process is subtracted from that generated by a power plant. Guidarini said Dow believes its proprietary amines technology is much less energy intensive than other processes. The pilot plant will capture about 1,800 tons of carbon dioxide a year. This is the second carbon capture project to be announced in West Virginia. The other project is much larger. Alstom, American Electric Power and German utility conglomerate RWE are building it at American Electric's Mountaineer power plant in Mason County. American Electric is investing about $76 million in the Mason County project, which is designed to capture about 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. Alstom has said that research shows its technology may only cause an energy loss of 10 percent. In addition to capturing carbon dioxide, the Mason County project will chill it to a liquid using Alstom's Chilled Ammonia Process. The liquid will be permanently stored underground. American Electric is working with subcontractor Battelle Memorial Institute on the storage system. The Mason County project is expected to begin operating in September.",

    "sentence": "Hotel project on, Tri-State vows. CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- Officials at Tri-State Racetrack & Gaming Center say they intend to proceed with a $250 million expansion project at the Kanawha County track and casino despite bad economic conditions that have hit the gambling industry particularly hard. Dan Adkins, vice president of Hartman & Tyner Inc., which owns the facility in Nitro, said he met with Gov. Joe Manchin on Thursday to talk about the track's future and assure state officials that he intended to make good on promises to build a hotel and entertainment complex at the track. \"I'm not coming with my hat off and my hand out,\" Adkins said Friday. He said he does not intend to ask state lawmakers to push back deadlines for a table-gaming referendum and the construction timetable at the track and casino. John Melton, attorney for the West Virginia Lottery Commission, said recently that the 2007 law allowing the expansion of table games requires the hotel to be up and running at Tri-State by the August 2010 deadline, not merely under construction. If Tri-State's owners fail to complete the hotel in time, they face a $2.5 million annual penalty until the hotel is open. With ground unbroken, no architect yet announced for the project and time running out, state and county officials are beginning to wonder whether Tri-State will be able to make the deadline. \"I think Tri-State has publicly committed to build a hotel, and will build it,\" said Kanawha County Commission President Kent Carper, who said he has watched the progress of Tri-State's plans closely. \"If they don't, the penalty is pretty unpleasant for them. They said they'd build it, and they need to build it,\" Carper said, but conceded that the hotel might not be finished in time to meet the deadline. \"To me, it wouldn't be the end of the world if it were delayed a year,\" he said. \"I just want to see it built.\" When the Legislature passed the law allowing local voters to approve the expansion of gambling to include table games such as poker and blackjack, the law required a vote after another five years so voters could decide if they wanted table gaming to continue. The law also required Tri-State to build a hotel. The state's other racetracks already have hotels at their facilities. Kanawha County voters approved table gaming at Tri-State Racetrack in August 2007. Carper said Adkins has had considerable trouble finding financing for the proposed $250 million expansion at Tri-State. The project includes a hotel of at least 200 rooms, a conference center and entertainment complex. \"You can't blame everything on Tri-State,\" Carper said. \"It's not their fault the economy is in the tank.\" The pain is being felt across the gambling industry. Last year, Tropicana Entertainment LLC, which runs the Tropicana Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, filed for bankruptcy. The company that runs Donald Trump's casino empire filed for bankruptcy in February. Herbst Gambling Inc., which operates a casino in Iowa, two more in Missouri and 12 in Nevada, announced plans to file for bankruptcy last week, according to the Des Moines Register newspaper. Carper said he was told that Adkins intended to ask state officials to push back the deadline on the table-gaming referendum to make it easier to secure financing for the project. With the referendum on table games looming, Carper said, investors or banking officials probably will be reluctant to loan a lot of money on a project that voters might decide they don't want anymore. \" [Extending the deadline] will assist them in getting financing,\" Carper said. Adkins acknowledges that times are hard and it has been tough to finance the expansion project, but he said he would not ask state officials to push back any deadlines for the track. \"We don't file bankruptcy,\" Adkins said. \"We're going to proceed with what we said we're going to do, with our own money.\" Matt Turner, spokesman for Gov. Manchin, confirmed that Adkins met with the governor Thursday to discuss \"the future of the racetrack.\" He said Manchin was \"encouraged\" by the conversation. Adkins said he hoped to pick an architect for the expansion project on Friday.",

    "sentence": "Obama signs protections for Mon Forest acreage. CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- Lewisburg Mayor John Manchester on Monday had a bird's-eye view of President Obama signing into law a bill granting wilderness protection to more than 2 million acres of land, including 37,771 acres in the Monongahela National Forest. \"For some reason, they stuck me in the second row,\" Manchester said after the signing. \"It was a wonderful ceremony, and I got to shake the president's hand and meet a lot of the congressional leaders.\" Manchester was among about 150 supporters of various pieces of the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009 who were invited to attend the bill-signing ceremony at the White House. The legislation protects tracts of federally managed land in nine states, from Oregon to Virginia. Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W. Va., chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee and a longtime backer of the legislation, was among 13 U.S. senators and representatives in attendance, along with Interior Secretary Ken Salazar. \"As Americans, we possess few blessings greater than the vast and varied landscapes that stretch the breadth of our continent,\" Obama said. The new law, he added, guarantees that Americans \"will not take our forests, rivers, oceans, national parks, monuments and wilderness areas for granted, but rather we will set them aside and guard their sanctity for everyone to share. That's something all Americans can support.\" In West Virginia, the Wild Monongahela Act, which was a component of the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act, creates three new wilderness areas in the Monongahela National Forest, and adds acreage to three existing wilderness areas. The new areas are the 6,280-acre Roaring Plains West Wilderness, which abuts the existing Dolly Sods Wilderness east of Canaan Valley; the 7,142-acre Spice Run Wilderness on the east slope of the Greenbrier River Valley near the Greenbrier-Pocahontas County boundary; and the 5,242-acre Big Draft Wilderness along Anthony Creek at the extreme south end of the Monongahela near Lewisburg. The act also added 7,215 acres to the north end of the Dolly Sods Wilderness; 12,032 acres between the Williams and Cranberry rivers in the Cranberry Wilderness; and 740 acres near the Dry Fork River to the Otter Creek Wilderness. Manchester was among wilderness supporters who testified before Rahall's committee last year. \"I spoke on the value of wilderness to my community,\" he said. \"There are a lot of tourists who love to explore wild places, and as soon as these new wilderness areas are on the map, we'll have another arrow in our quiver for our marketing campaign. I expect the new wilderness areas will give the state a significant bump in its tourism base.\" Elsewhere in the nation, the act added nearly 50,000 acres of wilderness to Virginia's Jefferson National Forest, and granted wilderness protection to land along Mount Hood's northeastern slopes in Oregon, to the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore in Michigan, in Utah's Zion National Park and in Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado.",

    "sentence": "Slide forces closure of W.Va. 61 in East Bank. Kanawha County emergency responders and state highway officials don't know exactly how long W.Va. 61 will be closed in East Bank because of a mudslide. But East Bank Mayor Chuck Blair said Monday that he expects the major thoroughfare to be shut down at least two days. \"They're still trying to determine how much damage there is,\" Blair said. \"There's a deep mine up there that has been accumulating water for years and years and years,\" Petry said. Kathy Cosco, spokeswoman for the state Department of Environmental Protection, said the mine last operated in the 1940s or 1950s. Classes at East Bank Middle School were also canceled as a result of the slide. Melanie Vickers, assistant superintendent in charge of middle schools, said East Bank Middle School will be open today. Principal Candy Strader drove to the school Monday and saw no damage inside the building, according to Vickers. \"She did get inside and said things were fine,\" she said. The problem was all the water that had spilled into the school's parking lot, Vickers said. After speaking with county transportation director George Beckett, Vickers said she believed bus drivers would be able to get students to the school safely. Kanawha County emergency responders and state highway officials don't know exactly how long W.Va. 61 will be closed in East Bank because of a mudslide. But East Bank Mayor Chuck Blair said Monday that he expects the major thoroughfare to be shut down at least two days. \"They're still trying to determine how much damage there is,\" Blair said. Kanawha County Emergency Services Director Dale Petry said an old, abandoned mine that had been dormantor for years started overflowing early Monday, sending hundreds of thousands of gallons of water cascading across W.Va. 61 and onto First Avenue in East Bank and forcing tons of rock and earth onto the road near the western end of town. \"There's a deep mine up there that has been accumulating water for years and years and years,\" Petry said. Kathy Cosco, spokeswoman for the state Department of Environmental Protection, said the mine last operated in the 1940s or 1950s. Classes at East Bank Middle School were also canceled as a result of the slide. Melanie Vickers, assistant superintendent in charge of middle schools, said East Bank Middle School will be open today. Principal Candy Strader drove to the school Monday and saw no damage inside the building, according to Vickers. \"She did get inside and said things were fine,\" she said. The problem was all the water that had spilled into the school's parking lot, Vickers said. After speaking with county transportation director George Beckett, Vickers said she believed bus drivers would be able to get students to the school safely. Petry said the slide forced the evacuation of one family whose driveway was obliterated by the mass of mud and water. Stacy Auber, who lives downhill from the old mine, said relatives called her about 6:20 a.m. and told her about the mudslide. Soon, a dump truck belonging to the family went sliding over the hill. Auber grabbed some clothes and left her house by about 10:30 a.m. She was allowed to return home Monday afternoon. But Johnny Walker, a highways administrator with the state Division of Highways, said highways officials can't even begin to guess how long it will take to clear away the debris and reopen W.Va. 61. He said it all depends on how badly the tons of mud and water damaged the two-lane highway. \"We've got a piling wall along that entire section, and it's undercut all of that,\" Walker said. Highways officials need to determine whether the ground beneath the road was undermined, and they won't know that until water stops pouring across the asphalt. Petry said discharge from the mine portal had slowed down by mid-afternoon, but that water continued to gush out of the abandoned mine at a rate of about 2,000 gallons per minute. Emergency officials reopened narrow First Avenue Monday afternoon to allow residents access to their homes, but the single-lane street will be open only to passenger vehicles. Mud and water also closed the inner set of railroad tracks, Petry said. All but local traffic was being rerouted at Cabin Creek Road and Paint Creek Road. \"We're kind of on pins and needles now to see what happens next with it,\" Blair said Monday afternoon. \"We don't know how much water is up there to come out.\"",

CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- Emilie Holroyd, a longtime fixture in West Virginia Democratic politics and a frequent representative of her state at the party's national conventions, has died at age 74. Derek Scarbro, executive director of the state Democratic Party, said Holroyd died Monday at Princeton Community Hospital following a long, undisclosed illness. Holroyd served various posts within the state party over the years, including as national committeewoman. \"She was always in the fray and in the thick of things,\" state party chairman Nick Casey said Monday. \"Emilie spent her entire life working tirelessly for what she believed in. This loss is not only a loss to Mercer County, but to our West Virginia Democratic Party and our entire state, as well,\" Casey said. U.S. Sens. Robert C. Byrd and Jay Rockefeller, both D-W. Va., each called Holroyd a dear friend. Byrd recalled her compelling personality and extraordinary networking skills. Rockefeller said Holroyd was a tireless volunteer and role model. Byrd said of Holroyd, \"She was a partisan out of principle, and she served her party, state and nation with intellect, passion and great good humor. She knew and worked for presidents, senators, congressmen, governors and state legislators, but she also knew county officials and poll workers and others who labor behind the scenes to get things done.\" Gov. Joe Manchin said he's never met anyone more passionate about her family, her beliefs and her community than Holroyd. \"The truth is that we did not always agree, but I have to tell you that I liked it much better when we did,\" Manchin said. \"Emilie had such strong devotion, and she was respected by all who knew her. Our thoughts go out to her husband, Bob, and the many loved ones as they go through this difficult time.\" CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- Emilie Holroyd, a longtime fixture in West Virginia Democratic politics and a frequent representative of her state at the party's national conventions, has died at age 74.",

    "sentence": "Taco Bell killer pleads guilty. CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- A Charleston man admitted in Kanawha Circuit Court on Monday that he gunned down his longtime girlfriend in a West Side Taco Bell in July 2008. Desmond Demetrius Clark, 22, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder, saying he shot Na'lisha Gravely, 19, with whom he had a son. \"I shot 'Lisha in the Taco Bell,\" Clark said. \"I later learned that she died from it.\" As part of the plea deal, prosecutors agreed to drop two wanton endangerment charges and a kidnapping charge against Clark. Clark, who had a lengthy history of domestic violence against Gravely, followed her into the Patrick Street restaurant, where she had apparently fled from him during an argument. Video surveillance appeared to show Clark hopping the counter moments before he fired into the closet where Gravely was hiding. Chief Kanawha Circuit Judge Jim Stucky accepted Clark's plea, and set his sentencing for June 2. Both sides are free to call witnesses and argue whether or not Clark's life sentence should come with a recommendation of mercy, meaning that he could eventually be paroled. Clark was captured following a brief manhunt. His arrest and subsequent murder charges set off an uproar, in part because of his extensive criminal history and in part because he was subject of a domestic violence protective order taken out by Gravely when he killed her. Clark turned and quietly said \"I love you\" to his supporters before he was led out of the courtroom. Gravely's family and friends left the courtroom without talking to reporters. After the hearing, Plants said he was pleased with the conviction and that he plans to ask Stucky to send Clark to prison for the rest of his life. \"The facts of this case are just brutal. He shot her in broad daylight. He admitted it,\" Plants said. Clark told Stucky that his son now lives with Gravely's family. Defense attorney Theresa Chisolm said Clark wanted to accept responsibility for his actions. Plants said Gravely's tragic murder brought additional attention to the issue of domestic violence. \"Women who are in the cycle of abuse need to get out of the cycle,\" he said. Earlier this month, the state Supreme Court touted the launch of its electronic domestic violence registry, which gives police officers statewide electronic access to domestic violence protective orders like the one a Kanawha County Family Court judge issued to Gravely on May 28, 2008. According to that order, Clark and Gravely were not supposed to be around each other until Aug. 28, 2008, a few days after she would have turned 20. A Dunbar police officer pulled over a car driven by Clark with Gravely in the passenger seat on the day of the murder, but, apparently unaware of the protective order, he ticketed Clark for driving on a suspended license and for having a small amount of marijuana. Clark was on probation at the time, having been sentenced by Stucky to two years probation in March 2008 for felony possession with intent to distribute and several misdemeanors. The domestic violence registry is now up and running in 14 counties, but those do not yet include Kanawha County, Supreme Court administrative director Steve Canterbury said Monday. A bailiff leads Desmond Clark out of the courtroom following his guilty plea Monday. Clark admitted that he shot and killed Na'lisha Gravely, the mother of his child, in a West Side Taco Bell in 2008.",

    "sentence": "House rejects attempt to force vote on marriage amendment. On Monday, Republicans in the House of Delegates tried to advance a bipartisan resolution that would define marriage in the state constitution, but the Democratic majority blocked their attempts. The \"Marriage Protection Amendment\" resolution (HJR5) introduced last month calls for a statewide referendum on whether to amend the constitution to define marriage as between one man and one woman. The measure has been stuck in the House Constitutional Revision Committee. On Monday, House Minority Leader Tim Armstead tried bring the resolution to the floor for a vote by moving to discharge it from committee. \"The overwhelming majority of West Virginians have let us know in no uncertain terms they want us to take action on this issue,\" the Kanawha County Republican said, adding that 30 other states have approved constitutional amendments on marriage. \"It's time for us to listen to the people we represent.\" Since 2000, West Virginia has had a Defense of Marriage Act, which bars the state from recognizing same-sex marriages performed elsewhere. But Armstead said recent events in other states dictated the state should amend its constitution. \"I think we've seen over the past few years why it's so urgent,\" he said. He pointed to legal challenges to Proposition 8 in California and the recognition of gay marriage in Massachusetts. \"This is an urgent issue,\" Armstead said. \"It's an issue that needs to be addressed. It's an issue we feel very strongly about.\" But the House voted 67-30 -- almost entirely along party lines -- to postpone Armstead's motion indefinitely, meaning the resolution can't be considered again this session. Delegates also passed a motion to cut off debate on the issue. The only comments from Democrats came from House Majority Leader Brent Boggs, D-Braxton, a sponsor of the resolution. Boggs said the legislative process had to take precedence over delegates' personal feelings on the issue. \"It's not good public policy to bypass the committee process,\" he said, reading from a prepared speech. Besides Armstead and Boggs, other sponsors of the resolution are Delegates Harold Michael, D-Hardy; Ricky Moye, D-Raleigh; John Overington, R-Berkeley; Linda Sumner, R-Raleigh; and Clif Moore, D-McDowell. Earlier this month, a telephone campaign by the Family Policy Council of West Virginia targeted House Judiciary Chairwoman Carrie Webster, D-Kanawha, and House Constitutional Revision Chairwoman Barbara Fleischauer, D-Monongalia. The council claimed the two delegates were blocking a ban on gay marriage, since their committees would have to approve the resolution. Webster, whose committee never saw the bill, said the campaign led to the harassment of her staff.",

    "sentence": "Funding to dry up on Friday for Charles Webb Center. The Charles Webb Center for developmentally disabled kids, which has survived on donations for nearly three months, is hoping for another miracle. The center has funding to stay open through Friday. It may be able to secure a grant this week to keep it running through April 3. The community has kept the center afloat since Jan. 1 with more than $30,000 in donations. The state Department of Disabilities and Special Needs cut $150,000 in annual funding for the center in response to a General Assembly mandate to trim $21.5 million or 11.2 percent from its budget. On the state House floor last week, Rep. Wendell Gilliard, D-Charleston, tried unsuccessfully to restore $250,000 in funding for the Webb Center and another center for developmentally disabled children in Anderson. \"They knocked it down,\" Gilliard said. \"I'm still soliciting private donations to keep the Webb Center afloat. It's an invaluable service to our children,\" he said. No one knows that better than Mindy Miller of Ravenel, whose son, Parker, 8, has Fragile X syndrome and is developmentally delayed by about three years. He has been at the Webb Center for nearly seven years. Miller and the other parents of the 30 children at the center said there is no place like it. \"You hang on to every day and hope that a miracle happens. It's kind of wearing me down. It's frustrating, an emotional roller coaster,\" Miller said. educable mentally disabled children at Drayton Hall Elementary School. After school, he takes a bus to the Webb Center on Evergreen Street, where he is picked up when his parents leave their business, Miller Signs, about 6 p.m. Several of the parents have said that if the Webb Center closes, it could mean they would have to quit their jobs to stay home to care for a special needs child. Parents learned Nov. 13 that the center would close at the end of the year because of state budget cuts. Kids at the center range from infants to age 10 and have developmental problems such as autism and mental retardation. The center has a staff of eight. The state Department of Disabilities and Special Needs cut funds for five child day-care programs, including the Webb Center. State Sen. Robert Ford, D-Charleston, said he is optimistic about restoring state funding to the Webb Center in the new budget year beginning July 1. \"We're almost sure that we're going to be able to do it,\" Ford said. The state money enables the center to receive matching Medicaid funds to meet its budget, officials said. On March 6, Ford, Gilliard and Senate President Pro Tem Glenn McConnell, R-Charleston, donated a total of $5,000 to the center. Ford said he has spoken with Sen. Finance Committee Chairman Hugh Leatherman, a Republican from Florence, who has been impressed with support for the center from local legislators. Ford said that House Speaker Bobby Harrell, R-Charleston, can pave the way for restoring center funding in the House. Ford said he thinks that the center also could be the beneficiary of federal stimulus money. Meanwhile, the Webb Center will be living from week-to-week on the largesse of the community. \"I can definitely go through next week. We're hoping for another two weeks,\" said Rick Magner, director of the Disabilities Board of Charleston County. The center's weekly operating cost is about $5,000, he said.",

ISLE OF PALMS — Two members of the city Planning Commission will appear on the May 12 ballot for a special election to fill Mayor Dick Cronin's unexpired City Council term. Barbara Bergwerf, 65, commission member, and commission Chairman Ron Denton, 46, both have filed for the seat. Concerns about the community's short-term rentals and development prompted Bergwerf, a retired artist and photographer, to run. \"I feel like I could do more for the community on the City Council than the planning commission,\" she said. Bergwerf said no one, herself included, is against renting out island homes, but she is concerned with large six- to 10-bedroom homes being built within residential neighborhoods. \"I'm concerned about development on the island and the future development of the island,\" she said. Denton, an architect, said he is running to unify the community. \"I just want to bring cohesiveness between those who live in Wild Dunes, those who live outside Wild Dunes and a cohesive conclusion to concerns regarding short-term rentals,\" he said. The Planning Commission has been reviewing the city's current short-term rental ordinance to judge its effectiveness. Denton said some people in the community would like stricter laws, but he said the law needs examination before the city makes anymore changes. Denton said he would keep his eye on the city budget as a councilman. City officials have embarked on a number of projects, including building a new public safety building, he said. Cronin was elected to finish out the former mayor's term in February. His council seat is up for re-election in November.",

    "sentence": "Columbia will have to pay firm for hotel. A judge ruled Monday that Columbia taxpayers owe design firm Stevens & Wilkinson money for a publicly funded hotel the city never built. The Columbia-based design firm says the city owes it $1.6 million for work it completed on a publicly funded convention center hotel project from December 2003 to April 2004. Two weeks ago, city attorneys rejected a $1.6 million settlement offer from Stevens & Wilkinson, saying the two entities never had a contract. Monday, Circuit Court Judge Casey Manning ruled the city did have a contract with Stevens & Wilkinson but did not rule if or how much money the city had to pay. That question will be settled later, in front of either a jury or a judge. But it means city taxpayers likely will have to pay something at a time when the city is furloughing its employees and cutting $4 million in order to make its budget this year. It’s unclear if the city will appeal the decision. Kathleen McDaniel, an attorney with Callison Tighe & Robinson, which represents the city, said Monday night she had not had time to review the order and declined to comment. “This ruling is a dramatic development on behalf of Stevens & Wilkinson,” said attorney Dick Harpootlian, who represents the design firm. “They owe us something, the amount to be determined.” Manning’s order, known as a partial summary judgment, is rare for a plaintiff, the party who brings the lawsuit, said John Nichols, past president of the S.C. Trial Lawyers Association, now known as the S.C. Association for Justice. “The plaintiff always has the burden of proof and the burden of production to start a lawsuit off,” Nichols said. It’s more likely that a defendant would win summary judgment, he said. In issuing his order, Manning cited the deposition testimony of three people: interim city manager Steve Gantt, Councilwoman Tameika Isaac Devine and Charles Phillips, an expert hired by the city. Further testimony is expected before it is determined what the city owes. Devine, an attorney, is the only council member to give a deposition so far. Attorneys for the city have asked Manning to prevent other council members from testifying on the grounds of legislative privilege — the legal doctrine that prevents public officials from being asked to explain their votes. In 2003, the city decided it would build and operate a hotel across from the Columbia Metropolitan Convention Center. City Council hired Stevens & Wilkinson, Turner Construction, Gary Realty and Garfield Traub Development to work on the project. All the parties signed a memorandum of understanding. However, in April 2004, after considerable public opposition to the project, City Council voted to give $4.5 million for a private developer — Bo Aughtry — to build the hotel, a Hilton, which opened in August 2007. In 2005, the four companies that had worked on the public hotel project sued the city, saying the city’s memorandum of understanding was a contract, and by going with a privately developed hotel, the city broke that contract. The companies are asking for the money the city would have paid them had the public hotel project gone forward. Monday’s ruling does not affect the status of the other companies; their portion of the lawsuit is still pending. “This is the first of what we hope will be a lot of dominoes to fall,” said attorney Brink Hinson, who represents Gary Realty and Garfield Traub Development. Stevens & Wilkinson is asking for an additional $1.6 million for work it says it completed on the project from December 2003 to April 2004. In July 2003, after working three months on the project, Stevens & Wilkinson said they were stopping their work until the city could borrow the money to pay for the hotel. Stevens & Wilkinson offered to continue working on the hotel project for $650,000 through Oct. 15, 2003, and $75,000 a week after that. City Council members approved this deal, and on Dec. 13, 2003, paid Stevens & Wilkinson $697,084.79 — which lead Manning to write: “Thus the three tenants of contract have been established: offer, acceptance and valuable consideration.”",

    "sentence": "Lexington County smoking ban push reignited. Supporters of a smoking ban for Lexington County settled Tuesday on a deal that is less than desired but is designed to end a stalemate. The plan would snuff smoking in restaurants and bars, except on outdoor decks and patios and inside private clubs that were open as of Jan. 1 this year. Restrictions in stores, offices and other places would remain at the owner’s discretion. “It’s the best we can get right now,” council chairman Debbie Summers said. The plan quickly won approval from a County Council committee, setting the stage for ending a conflict that has persisted since fall. The nine-member council can take it up as soon as April 14. Some supporters say the proposal is the last attempt to break the standoff. “If this doesn’t make it, the deal is dead,” Councilman Bill Banning said. But he expects narrow approval next month. Allowing smoking decks and patios is “creating miniature leper colonies,” Councilman Todd Cullum said. All nearby communities with a ban allow that except for the town of Lexington. Mayor Randy Halfacre said he will seek to permit smoking decks and patios in his community if the new county plan for unincorporated areas is put into place. But town leaders will stick with their ban on smoking inside any workplace, he said. The new plan for county restrictions is “a big step” even though it is less than some advocates want, Halfacre said. The plan received a mixed reaction from one spokesman for the bar and restaurant industry. Bars and restaurants can live with a uniform ban, Tom Sponseller said. “If it’s a level playing field, everyone gets treated the same, and there’s no harm,” he said. But he is concerned the exemption for private clubs could become either a loophole or a restriction so tight that it also bars smoking in country clubs and sites that nonprofit clubs operate for members.",

    "sentence": "Lexington 4 to raise taxes, cut staff. Lexington 4’s proposed 2009-10 spending plan will include reductions in the overall budget and staff, the result of declining revenue and enrollment in the upcoming academic year. Superintendent Linda Hawkins outlined a $21.8 million spending plan Monday, a $1.2 million reduction over the current level — even with a property tax increase to make up for having less state aid. The proposed tax hike — the maximum allowed — amounts to an extra $57 yearly for the owner of a home valued at $100,000. The financial picture is “the worst I’ve ever seen,” Hawkins said. The spending plan submitted to the school board calls for a staff reduction of nearly 18 — 14 teachers and four others, with some going to part time. The district now has 457 employees. More than half of the teachers eliminated are retirees who had come back to the classroom. The staff cuts reflect an expected enrollment decline of nearly 100 students, to 3,200, in the Gaston and Swansea area schools. “We are looking at every possible thing we could cut, working smarter,” Hawkins said. Hawkins wants to avoid staff furloughs. “That is an option we don’t want to do. If things get much worse, we may have to.” The seven-member board is waiting until May to see whether revenue forecasts improve or worsen before acting on the plan. The cuts reflect “dire times,” board chairwoman Sheila Parkman said. “You’ve made some good choices,” Lawrence Livingston said of the plan.",

Families and young professionals have also discovered the city's first- rate services, outstanding park facilities and recreation programs, and big- city amenities while preserving a small- town feel. Spanning more than 20 square miles, Greer's city limits to the north offer outdoor recreation at Lake Robinson, Lake Cunningham, and Apalache Lake, while the city's southern boundary includes a major transportation corridor with Interstate 85 and the Greenville- Spartanburg International Airport. Downtown Greer, known locally as Greer Station, has become a destination in itself with approximately 12 square blocks of retail, dining, entertainment, and professional service organizations. Greer Station has more than 40 buildings on the National Historic Register. Greer Station took on a new look in 2008 as new municipal facilities opened to serve the public. A two- story Police and Court Complex anchors the west boundary of Greer Station, while the new three- story Greer City Hall and 12- acre City Park are just two blocks to the east. City Hall includes an entire floor dedicated to public space, with a 4,500- square- foot events hall available for conventions, receptions, and galas. Just steps from the events hall, City Park includes a large fountain timed to music, an amphitheater for public concerts and ceremonies, walking trails, a picnic shelter, a pond, and ample green space for family fun. The city's events staff keeps City Park the center of recreation in Greer, planning concerts and family festivals throughout the year. The 2009 Fourth of July Celebration at City Park July 4- 5 will offer a weekend of music and fireworks not to be missed. Highway 29 extends from Greenville to Spartanburg and passes just north of Greer's main business district. However, you will find nearly anything you may want on that stretch of highway in Greer. From fast food or fine dining to charming boutiques and chain department stores, it is a vibrant commercial corridor in the city. Home to the nation's only BMW manufacturing plant, which offers public tours departing from an informative visitor's center, Greer also has been home to the Michelin North America main headquarters for almost a quarter of a century.",

All members were present: Mayor Bobby E. Horton, Mayor Pro- Tem Tommy G. Parler, Eric L. Fowler, L. Dale Harley, Jack L. Harmon, Boyd J. Jones, Marsha J. Moore, Cathy Shannon and B.J. Unthank. John Banks, director of tourism with the West Metro Chamber of Commerce spoke on the various ways the chamber is promoting the area. Among other points, Banks said that special emphasis would be given to improving West Metro's brochures and encouraging business travelers to stay in West Columbia hotels. Additionally, Banks told council that the chamber was working to redesign its ads at the Columbia Metropolitan Airport. Banks said that a frequent complaint from visitors was that the ads at the airport were difficult to read. Banks added that the chamber would be promoting the West Columbia area's whitewater rafting opportunities. He reminded council that visitors can go whitewater rafting in the morning and see a play in Columbia that evening. Councilman Harley said he was particularly impressed with this idea. Banks also announced that the chamber was completely redesigning its website. Banks said that Splash Omnimedia of Lexington, South Carolina has been hired for the job. Mayor Horton said the city of West Columbia had received a grant from the state to assist in domestic violence evidence collection. The mayor reminded council members of their upcoming budget meetings. First reading unanimous approval was given to an ordinance that would move West Columbia city elections to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in odd- numbered years. Currently, the city holds elections on the first Tuesday in September on those years. Mayor Horton pointed out the reason for the ordinance was to align the city with other municipalities in Lexington County and to encourage voter turnout, as most voters are used to casting their ballots in November. Unanimous approval was given to a resolution authorizing the mayor to award contracts to the lowest responsive, responsible bidders to improve the city's water and sewer system contingent upon authorization by SRF Authority. Tom Bowlers with AECOM addressed council briefly on the matter and responding to a question from Councilman Fowler said the work on the city's water and sewer system would likely begin in about 30 to 45 days, once the credentials and qualifications of the subcontractors have been examined and additional documents had been received. Unanimous approval was given to a resolution authorizing the consumption of beer and wine in cups at the Riverwalk Music Festival and the Rhythm on the River Concert Series at the Riverwalk Amphitheatre. Mayor Horton strongly emphasized that beer and wine consumption would only be allowed at the Riverwalk Amphitheatre during those specific events.",

    "sentence": "Riverbanks welcomes three black- necked swan cygnets . The cygnets only spent about a day in the nest. By Saturday they ventured into the water with their parents in search of food. Unlike birds that nest in trees, the offspring of waterfowl are known as \"precocial\" species, which means they hatch with feathers, can see, and can feed themselves. The fluffy white chicks are currently on exhibit with their parents in the pond at Riverbanks' Bird Garden (opposite the Bird Conservation Center). Guests will most likely see them swimming around the exhibit or catching a ride on the back of one of their parents; you may have to look closely though, sometimes they tuck under their parents' wings for protection. This is the first set of offspring for the pair. The male, 9, came to Riverbanks in 2000 from the Santa Ana Zoo and the female, 5, came in 2004 from the Alexandria Zoo. Both animals are considered young parents, as swans can live into their 40s. The pair began nestbuilding in early January. The swans start by sitting on the ground and pulling organic material toward their bodies to build a nest up around them. The result is a conical- shaped shell. The birds then line it with feathers plucked from their own body to serve as insulation for the eggs when the parents are not on the nest. The cygnets, which are currently covered in down feathers, will begin growing juvenile feathers in two months.",

Owens encouraged students that, despite the current economic climate, he believes the area of film and entertainment will continue to grow and there will be many new jobs generated by festivals. “As the distribution of cinema changes, film festivals are more important than ever for shedding light on works of unique and challenging cinema that most filmgoers don’t get to see at the cineplex,” Owens said. “There is a growing infrastructure being created to help young filmmakers and open new markets among people who like to make and watch movies on television, on the computer and in theaters.” Nashville Film Festival Director Brian Owens, right, speaks with Stewart Lenig, head of the Columbia State Community College drama department, and CSCC student Trishae Dotson following his presentation at the college earlier this month.",

This exhibit will be featured in the Marly Berger Gallery through May 9. Working from memory, with only a pocketknife and the occasional handsaw, James Bunch has produced a body of work estimated at 300 pieces which range in subject matter from the familiar tools and mechanics which have been central to his life to elaborate pieces notable for their detail and kinetic features. “His human figures are perhaps most striking, consistently stylized as stiff but expressive individuals sharing hallmarks of character and community,” said Robert Cogswell, director of folklife for the Tennessee Arts Commission. Careful inspection of his work reveals not only fine carving but a commitment to carefully executing every part of his creations. Using the skills of a traditional wood carver, Bunch invents shockingly realistic creations that have to be seen to be believed. Admission to “An Old Man Has Visions” is free. The gallery is open from 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Monday-Saturday. The Arts Center is located on 1424 John Bragg Highway. More information is available by calling (615) 563-2787 or (800) 235-9073.",

Cole said the government spent less than that on weatherization programs for all 50 states last year. \"What we're being asked to do has never been done before,\" said Cole, who speaks for the anti-poverty organizations that will do most of the work. \"There's no pattern to follow.\" But there is an ideal path, which supporters describe in one-thing-leads-to-another terms: Agencies hire weatherization workers or contract with small businesses, creating jobs. They also buy trucks, insulation supplies, furnaces and water heaters, boosting the local economy. Residents' utility costs drop by an average of 30 percent, saving money and energy. Heating subsidies for the poor cost taxpayers less, and families spend the extra cash. \"This thing has so many opportunities for mischief and mismanagement,\" said Leslie Paige, spokeswoman for Citizens Against Government Waste, a taxpayer watchdog organization based in Washington, D.C. \"It's very vulnerable to fraud.\" She said the pot is too large and the ramp-up time too short for small community-action agencies to manage. \"You're taking a sleepy little program and you're going to ram $5 billion at it, and on top of that you're going to say it has to be spent as quickly as possible,\" Paige said. \"It's a recipe for disaster.\" Some also question whether the program really can put more than 87,000 Americans to work, as President Barack Obama asserts. No one expects it to be easy, said Bill Graves of the Ohio Department of Development. Ohio received about $30 million in federal money for weatherization in 2008, so the stimulus money represents an increase of almost 800 percent. \"What are my worries? I wouldn't say worries; I'd say optimistic concerns,\" he said. \"This is a lot of money. It's a monumental task.\" Pat Williams says she's ready. As manager of the weatherization program at Impact Community Action Agency in Columbus, she could soon oversee a threefold increase in production. On a sunny, warm-for-March day last week, Williams had three crews of three working on drafty city homes. \"I'll have three more crews in the next few weeks,\" she said. \"When the stimulus hits, I plan to go to 16 to 20. This is going to make a tremendous difference in people's lives.\" Williams also is excited about the agency's ability to offer jobs with health insurance. She wants to hire as many people as possible, but Impact Executive Director Bo Chilton said the community-action agency doesn't want to create more positions than it can maintain. \"We'd hate to take on 30 new staff and then lay them off in two years,\" he said. \"So we'll probably be using contractors, too.\" Whether to create jobs or hire businesses can be a thorny issue for community-action agencies, most of whose missions include employment training. \"They're both legitimate business models,\" said Dave Rinebolt, executive director of Ohio Partners for Affordable Energy, an umbrella group for energy-assistance groups. \"We anticipate plenty of jobs either way.\" Sean Babylon is thrilled to have one. The 32-year-old recently moved back to Columbus from Arkansas and badly wanted to return to Impact, where he had worked in weatherization before. He was surprised to learn that the agency could add employees. \"It's a big weight off my shoulders,\" Babylon said. \"I wake up and think, 'Wow. I have a job now.'\" Home weatherization as a public program has its roots in New England during the energy crisis of the 1970s, said Rinebolt, who first worked in Minnesota. He watched support wither during the next two decades and eventually lost his job to budget cuts. The coming boom is an about-face like nothing he has ever seen. About 7,000 low-income Ohio homes usually are weatherized each year at a maximum per-unit cost of about $3,900. With the stimulus money, the program could reach 26,000 homes a year at up to $6,500 each.",

    "sentence": "Compromise required for transportation bill to pass. Ohio lawmakers voted almost completely in lockstep with their parties on a bill to provide billions of dollars for road projects, move forward with plans for passenger trains and toughen rules on drivers. Now they'll have to learn the art of the compromise. The House, controlled by Democrats, approved nearly all of Gov. Ted Strickland's two-year, $9.5 billion transportation budget, including controversial provisions green-lighting speed cameras in construction zones; a study of passenger rail service connecting Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton and Cincinnati; stronger enforcement of seat-belt laws; and solar- and wind-energy projects on the right-of-way along the Ohio Turnpike. The Senate, controlled by Republicans, wiped out nearly all of those provisions, although the train idea held on by a thread. Democrats say cameras to nab speeders in construction zones and enforcement of the seat-belt law as a primary offense meaning drivers can be ticketed even if it's their only violation will enhance public safety. Republicans say the changes are about money and infringe on personal freedom. Democrats say the rail plan would provide a new transportation option for Ohioans and stimulate economic development. Many Republicans say the idea hasn't been adequately researched and may not find enough riders. Democrats say the state owns plenty of unused land along the turnpike that could generate green energy. Republicans say the idea was too ill-defined for them to approve. Those disputes, and dozens of smaller differences between the House and Senate bills, now go to a bipartisan, six-member conference committee to iron out the differences. The committee is tasked with developing a final bill that both chambers will either accept or reject. Though once used regularly, conference committees became a far rarer occurrence in the past decade-plus, as members of the Republican-controlled legislature grew to view the committees as a failure of compromise. But with a new Democratic-controlled House and GOP-run Senate for the first time in 16 years, the conference committee should see a resurgence. \"As a leader, you kind of want a bill to go conference committee because you have more control over it,\" said Sen. Jon Husted, a Kettering Republican who served four years as House speaker. The conference committee is scheduled to do its work today, Wednesday and Thursday if needed. It won't have time to dawdle: Strickland must sign the final compromise bill by March 31. The budget is for the 2010-11 fiscal years, which begin July 1, and the legislation doesn't take effect for 90 days. Conceivably, the conference committee could strip out the more controversial provisions such as the new driver rules and move forward on the rest of the bill. Scott Varner, a spokesman for the Ohio Department of Transportation, said it's been at least a quarter-century since the agency's budget wasn't approved by the March 31 deadline. Herb Asher, professor emeritus of political science at Ohio State University, said he doesn't expect partisan wrangling to doom the transportation budget this year. \"You can't have endless stalemate,\" he said. \"Transportation is very important to the state, very important to the economy.\" There could be horse-trading on some of the items; for example, Republicans could yield on the speed cameras in exchange for Democrats dumping the seat-belt provision. But Asher said it doesn't have to be that simple. \"Conference committees have a substantial amount of power,\" he said. \"You don't have to split the difference.\" Husted said it remains unknown how the new Statehouse political dynamics will play out. House Speaker Armond Budish, D-Beachwood, is new to the process and veteran Senate President Bill M. Harris, R-Ashland, has been out of Columbus for weeks with a badly broken leg. \"What does happen will foreshadow how problems are solved with the operating budget, which is a far bigger issue,\" Husted said of that $54.4 billion two-year spending plan, which will be decided in June.",

    "sentence": "County's tornado-siren dead zones still unresolved. The county operates 157 of them, but coverage remains spotty in the southeast and southwest corners. An additional 17 sirens are scheduled to be installed in Columbus, Pleasant Township, Madison Township and Grove City this year. No one knows exactly how many sirens the county needs, but one planning document allows for 200, said Michael R. Pannell, the county's director of emergency management and homeland security. Individual jurisdictions are responsible for buying the sirens, and the county handles their operation. Pleasant and Madison townships both used a three-year, no-interest loan program through the county to buy the $20,000 sirens. Dublin operates its own sirens and is fully covered with 24, said Michael Racey, a city spokesman. Wednesday's statewide drill is largely meant to prepare Ohioans for tornado season, which runs from April through July, according to the state's Emergency Management Agency. While the sirens go off, alerts will be broadcast on television and radio. State officials say they hope that schools, businesses and families will practice their disaster plans. That's part of the reason the drill is scheduled for 9:50 a.m., said Kelli Blackwell, a spokeswoman for the state agency. People will be at work and school, where they can practice. It also avoids conflicts with broadcasters who have news updates at the top of the hour. Franklin County typically tests its sirens at noon on Wednesdays. If people don't have disaster plans to practice, maybe Wednesday's drill and the state's Severe Weather Awareness Week, which ends Sunday, will have them thinking about one, Pannell said. \"Be aware about what you can do to be better prepared,\" he said.",

    "sentence": "State falls short of spending targets for minority businesses. A state law on the books since 1980 requires agencies to set aside 15 percent of purchases for bidding by minority-owned businesses only. But total spending with minority companies in fiscal year 2008 was 3 percent of $2.3 billion. Purchases from companies participating in the Encouraging Diversity, Growth and Equity program, or EDGE, totaled 2.1 percent last year - while the goal in the state's administrative code since 2004 is 5 percent. \"These numbers are staggering,\" said state Sen. Ray Miller, D-Columbus, a vocal advocate of compliance with minority-business participation goals. \"It's unacceptable.\" Gov. Ted Strickland required the scorecard for the first time as part of an executive order he issued last June that sought better participation in the state's Minority Business Enterprise and EDGE programs. The idea was that requiring an annual measurement would spur better compliance, and the governor ordered other steps such as requiring each state agency to appoint an officer to monitor compliance. The scorecard for the 2008 fiscal year, which ended June 30, showed that only one of 22 cabinet agencies met the 15 percent spending goal for minority-owned businesses. Of the 12 reporting state colleges and universities, two met the goal, while six of the 58 state boards and commissions were in compliance. \"The governor expects to see improvement in the future,\" spokeswoman Amanda Wurst said. \"This scorecard certainly will provide us a baseline for improvements.\" Ron Sylvester, a spokesman for the Department of Administrative Services, said the state is working with agencies to identify missed opportunities for using minority or disadvantaged vendors and to find new vendors if necessary. State law says that if no bid is submitted by a minority-owned business for contracts set aside for such companies, the purchase is made according to usual procedures. Miller argued that the state must aggressively market opportunities to minority and disadvantaged companies, streamline the certification process for them and encourage majority contractors to subcontract with them. \"We should see some change because I am certain the governor is going to give this the highest priority and strongly encourage his cabinet and all other agencies of state government to do much better than they have in the past,\" he said. Various statements have been made in previous administrations, both Democratic and Republican, about the need to increase contracts and state jobs for minorities. Paul Mifsud, the late chief of staff for former Gov. George V. Voinovich, even said in 1995 that the Cleveland Republican \"is a guy that lives and breathes equity\" and is committed to affirmative action \"every day of the year.\"",

Decatur city officials have scheduled two community meetings for later this month to talk about plans to ease overcrowding by reconfiguring school attendance zones. The meeting dates are March 17 and March 25. Both meetings start at 6:30 p.m. and are billed as dual “informational and listening” sessions. The reconfiguration plans have caused a stir among parents since early indications that officials might move all fourth- and fifth-graders to the city’s lone middle school. Fourth- and fifth-graders now attend classes in the standalone Glennwood Academy campus. If the plan proceeds, Glennwood would house only kindergarten through third grade. The move would help the system weather an expected increase in students, particularly in elementary grades. According to system officials, the number of students in kindergarten through eighth grade is expected to grow over the next four years from 1,897 to 2,388. However, parents have told school board members that they worry about having the younger students on the same campus as older students, and said the middle school campus itself would grow too big City schools Superintendent Phyllis Edwards expects to present a plan to the board in May.",

The land in unincorporated DeKalb contains the aging Williamsburg Apartment complex. It currently is designated for “suburban” use. The proposed use would allow greater density and more intense uses, such as shops, restaurants and condos, assuming the land also was re-zoned. Neighborhood groups in the area, including StandUp DeKalb, which helped to halt a mixed-use project proposed by Sembler Co. also on North Druid Hills Road, have voiced concern about increasing the density in that area. The issue appears on the county commission’s evening agenda Tuesday. But both commissioners who represent the area — Kathie Gannon and Jeff Rader — said in interviews that the application is premature. They said they want to see more planning in and around the project site. The meeting begins at 6:30 p.m. at the Manuel Maloof auditorium, 1300 Commerce Dr., in downtown Decatur.",

But even the bill’s sponsor admits it is unclear if the idea will win over DeKalb County lawmakers, considering most of the businesses in the proposed annexation area along College Avenue object. State Rep. Stephanie Stuckey Benfield has tried and failed, twice, before in an annexation bid for Avondale. “I’ve never gotten the 10 signatures in the past,” the Decatur Democrat said of the county delegation’s rules for the needed number of sponsors for local legislation. “But it makes sense, and it’s something that is important for that area.” The latest proposal calls for the cities’ borders to meet at Sams Crossing. Both cities have backed away from larger annexations, in part because of resident objections. This plan, though, involves mostly commercial lots, 10 in Decatur and 22 in Avondale. That means the property owners would not likely be city voters or, in Decatur’s case, would not overburden local schools. “They’re just going for the people who can’t vote against it,” said Charles Blalock, who opposes the annexation and owns three of the lots in Avondale’s sights. “Don’t drag me into your town just to get more dollars,” Blalock said. Leaders in both cities say their main goal is to square their borders and provide better police service in the area. For Avondale, trying to redevelop its downtown, it’s also about having the power to force garages and small business in the proposed annex zone to clean up their appearance. “It’s really a gateway into Avondale, and we’d like to see some improvements in that corridor,” said Avondale Mayor Ed Rieker. The annexation bill is scheduled to go before the county delegation on Tuesday.",

    "sentence": "Six Clayton County students honored. If you could ignore the flash of cameras, the hovering video recorders and a celebrity or two, it was just the ladies having an intimate, upscale Sunday lunch. A bit of conversation and a little food — OK, a gourmet meal including filet mignon and crème brulée — shared by six high school seniors and a few new friends, hosted by Tanya Rodriguez Ski in her eight-bedroom Dunwoody home. It was, she said, an awards ceremony disguised as a get-together. “We have our own legends right here in our town. I want these young ladies to get a chance to sit down and talk with people they might read about or see on television,” Ski said. In its second such event, the Frank Ski Kids Foundation was honoring six Clayton County high school students chosen for their leadership and academics: Mia Gipson, Morgan McGhee, Janeau’ Wright, Genetta Reeves, Chidinma Anyiwo and Kayla Swain. They represented Lovejoy, Jonesboro, Mundy’s Mill and North Clayton high schools. The Frank Ski Kids Foundation is named for the V-103 radio personality; Tanya is his wife and the group’s president. As the sun streamed in, Fleming’s Steakhouse produced a steady stream of dishes. At one end of the table was Grammy winner Monica; at the other, Xernona Clayton, former assistant to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and later an executive at TBS. Monica cautioned the teens that every person’s actions can be for good or ill. She urged them not to surrender control of their lives, saying, “I have never believed in living in somebody else’s shadow. I made my own decisions. What outside people think, you need to keep on the outside.” Clayton, founder of the Trumpet Awards Foundation, which honors accomplished African-Americans, praised Sunday’s event. “I hope these kids will learn and pass it on. As a society, we must help each other,” she said. The high school seniors were transported to the event in a 30-foot Escalade limousine. After lunch, they were given an upscale goodie bag that included a BCBG dress, a set of fragrances, a devotion book, an overnight bag and a certificate of accomplishment. Oh — and a $1,000 scholarship. “I was pretty shocked,” said Kayla Swain, a Lovejoy senior who expects to attend Ohio State University in the fall. The money, advice and support are meant to reward talented young women but also to add to their momentum. For instance, Chidinma Anyiwo is a Mundy’s Mill senior who is headed next year to the University of Georgia. Four years from now, she hopes to be ready for medical school. Four years ago, she was in Nigeria. “My uncle was here,” she said, “and he said if we came here, we would get more opportunity to become whatever we want to be.” It's a Southern tradition like nowhere else.",

The suspect fled the area, and was seen running toward a residence in the 500 block of Taylor Street. Video surveillance led police to a residence on that block, and Keith D. Johnson, 41, was arrested on charges of attempted robbery and aggravated battery, according to the news release. The victim of the robbery was not harmed, but the person who came to her aid received a minor injury to his hand, according to the news release. Bond was set at $20,000 Saturday morning for Johnson during an appearance in the DeKalb County Courthouse, according to staff at the DeKalb County Jail.

    "sentence": "Sycamore family serving as March for Babies am bas sadors. Annika Jones quickly drifts off to sleep Saturday. Nestled in her mother’s arms, content from having just finished a bottle, she sighs softly as she naps. Kristina and Tim Jones, both 27, refer to 9-month-old Annika as their “little miracle.” The couple lost their first child, Hailey, in May 2006 just 15 minutes after she was born during Kristina’s 26th week of pregnancy. Two miscarriages followed before Annika was born June 13. “I don’t think, up until the day I went to the hospital, that I would go in and have a C-section and come home with a baby,” Kristina said. The Jones family is this year’s am bas sador family for the March for Babies in DeKalb County. A fundraiser for the March of Dimes, it will be held April 25 in Hopkins Park in DeKalb. The county’s walk raised more than $54,000 last year, and Lisa Kijowski, chairwoman of the March for Babies of DeKalb County, would like to exceed that this year. The March of Dimes is a nonprofit that works to improve the health of babies through research and education. Its goals are to prevent birth defects, premature birth and infant mortality, according to the organization’s Web site. An estimated half-million babies are born premature annually in the country, according to March of Dimes. The Jones family said the organization has provided support and information to them, and they lauded the group for the funding it provides for research and educational efforts. This is the third year they have taken part in the local walk. Team Hailey, which consists of about 30 friends and family members, has raised a combined $13,000 during those three years for the March of Dimes. They accepted the role of 2009 ambassador family for the local walk so they should share their story, Tim said. “More often, you hear the good stories, where the baby survived,” he said. “We weren’t as fortunate. But it’s a story that people need to hear because it does happen.” Kijowski said the ambassador family usually is “someone who has been truly touched” and has a direct connection with the March of Dimes. “I think people have a tendency to forget when there is not the sight of a physical family or babies there to share their story,” Kijowski said. “Usually, when the ambassador family has shared their story, there’s not a dry eye in the house.” The Joneses’ story starts with Hailey, who was born with Ebstein’s anomaly, a heart defect in which the tricuspid valve is abnormally formed. The tricuspid valve normally has three “flaps,” or leaflets, according to the American Heart Association. With Ebstein’s anomaly, one or two flaps are stuck to the wall of the heart. Kristina had gone to the doctor because she hadn’t felt Hailey move much; after an ultrasound, the doctor told the Joneses that the baby was in distress and needed to be born immediately through a Caesarean section. At 26 weeks, Hailey had a 40 percent chance of survival. Tim and Kristina said they were in shock at the news. When a pediatrician told them there would be some decisions to make after the birth, “we both knew what that meant,” Kristina said. “I don’t even think we had time to think. It went really fast,” Kristina recalled. “She lived 15 minutes. That’s it.” Tim and family members were told first; Tim told Kristina when she awoke after surgery. “I don’t know how we went through it,” Kristina said. “I don’t know how we’re here smiling. It’s unnatural. Parents aren’t supposed to see their child die.” Doctors advised Kristina and Tim to wait a year before trying to have another child, which they said was hard but gave them time to grieve. Frequent visits with doctors and specialists led to Annika’s birth last year. Hailey is never far from their minds, Kristina said, and being able to help other babies in her name is an honor. “We can raise this money for other babies, so when other babies are born at 26 weeks with a heart condition, one day, none of them dies,” she said. “That’s our passion. We don’t want to see families go through what we went through.” March for Babies For information about the March for Babies in DeKalb County, call Lisa Kijowski at 815-899-5743. Visit www.marchforbabies.org for more information. This year’s walk starts at 10 a.m. April 25 at Hopkins Park in DeKalb. The March for Babies of DeKalb County is sponsored by Kishwaukee Community Hospital and Valley West Community Hospital, as well as The National Bank & Trust Co., Castle Bank and Soft Water City. A fundraiser will be held April 1 at Culver’s, 1200 DeKalb Ave. in Sycamore. A portion of proceeds from that day will be donated to the March of Dimes.",

MALTA – About 5,000 books are stacked on, under and around tables near the entrance to the Kishwaukee College library, separated into subjects as diverse as those on the library shelves – job search, self-help, textbooks, encyclopedias and a small mountain of paperback fiction. \"We've been getting donations throughout the year and discarding throughout the year, and we had a book drive about a month ago,\" library staffer Mary Middleton said. \"A lot are related to the degrees and programs we have here at the college, and we got a lot of fiction donations.\" And those thousands of books are available for purchase this week during the library's annual book sale. Paperbacks in the sale are priced at 50 cents and hardcover books at $1. The proceeds from the sale will help the library to purchase new books and materials, Middleton said. When deciding which books to discard, the library staff consider the condition of the book and the number of titles on the shelf with the same subject, she said. They also consider the age of the information. While the information contained in art books never expires, she said, computer or political science texts can become obsolete. \"We try to keep the library updated with relevant information,\" Middleton said. Some of the most desirable books were snapped up early by used book dealers waiting outside the door when the library opened Monday, Middleton said. The books that don't sell by the time the event ends Saturday will either be set out on tables for students to take for free or will be sent to an online used book distributor for sale, she said. Though the annual book sale has been going on since 2004, it's not the only opportunity to get a deal on the library's used books, Middleton added. A section of shelves on the library's second floor is filled with books that are always on sale, she said. \"That sale goes on year round, so if someone misses the book sale, they might want to come check that out,\" she said. If You Go The Kishwaukee College library's annual book sale is being held through Saturday in the library on the college's campus at Route 38 and Malta Road in Malta.

    "sentence": "Two vying for Kirkland president post. The two candidates running for Kirkland president have one thing in common: Both have held the office before. Incumbent Mike Becker is facing village trustee Les Bellah in the April 7 election for village president. Bellah was village president from 1996-2004. “I’ve really missed sitting at that part of the table and interfacing with people, with business owners, on the one-on-one basis,” Bellah said Monday when asked why he wanted to run for village president again. “Those people look for some guidance and leadership and I feel like I provide both.” Becker has been president for the past four years and said he wants to continue doing a job he enjoys. He described himself as “a little more cautious or conservative,” traits he said are beneficial for an elected official to have. “Sometimes decisions are made in a quick manner or are looking for cheapest solution and that may or may not be the best solution,” he said. “I like to look into and understand each issue totally before developing a solution for it.” If elected, Becker said he would focus on the city’s economic survival. He would ensure the village “maintains community services within our limits during tough economic times.” It will be tough, he said, because he doesn’t expect the village’s revenue to increase much in the near future. “I’m not not sure how we do that. We have to keep a very careful eye on what we spend and how we spend it, and make the most that we can with our money,” he said. Bellah said he would focus on spending as well, but said he would provide “little or no compromise” on keeping the police and public works departments well staffed because both are needed to ensure public safety. He advocated for expanding neighborhood watch programs to “let the people be the eyes and the ears of the police department.” And he said he would ask residents to support local businesses, noting many leave the village to shop elsewhere. Bellah said he would go door-to-door to talk to residents about that, or hold town meetings were shopkeepers could talk to residents about their struggles to stay afloat. A priority for Becker would be to examine options for the village’s wastewater treatment plant. The existing plant is “getting near the end of its life term,” he said, and the village needs to consider methods of replacing it. “Given these times, I’m not sure we can do it,” Becker said, adding he would recommend the village seek federal funding for assistance. At the very least, he said, they need to start planning for a new one. Another priority for Bellah is enforcement of traffic laws in the village. Many motorists traveling on Route 72 through the village exceed the speed limit, which is 35 miles per hour coming into and leaving town, and 30 in the village, he said. “The trucks speed through extremely fast, and people are running stop signs,” he said. “I don’t know what they think the word ‘Stop’ means.” Both men said they would be a good fit for the job. “Kirkland is my home. I really care deeply about what goes on in the community,” Becker said. “In the years I’ve been on the village board, residents know they can come to me with a problem and I will try to get to the bottom of it,” Bellah said.",

    "sentence": "NICE to tidy neighborhoods. DeKALB – Residents in the city’s fourth ward might soon be getting a knock on their door and an invitation to clean up. A pilot program that aims to tidy DeKalb neighborhoods was unanimously approved by the DeKalb City Council Monday. The Neighborhood Improvement Coordination Effort, or NICE program, will kick off during NIU Cares Day – a day devoted to performing volunteer work in the community – which is April 18 this year. Northern Illinois University students volunteering that day would be enlisted to clean up participating properties along public alleys and streets in the area between Fourth and Seventh streets bounded by Culver and Charter streets. This area was chosen because it contains alleys that have long been neglected, Public Works Director Rick Monas said. Jamie Smirz, the city’s special projects coordinator, said the goal is to get different programs to work together as one. “We have a lot of programs that the city already offers that we will be basically educating the neighborhood about,” Smirz said. “It really is an extension of our rehab program.” Rather than trying to combat property maintenance issues through strict code enforcement, NICE would encourage residents to take part in rehab programs, like the city’s partnership with the DeKalb Lowe’s store. Lowe’s gives the city supplies for free or at discounted prices, which the city distributes to qualified applicants – usually low-income homeowners or people recommended by social service agencies, Acting City Planner Sue Guio said. Other programs use federal dollars from the Community Development Block Grant to rehab homes. It’s the first time the city is trying to utilize these programs on an area-wide effort rather than on an individual basis, Guio said. “It’s more of an interpersonal contact of making people aware of what the city can offer,” 4th Ward Alderwoman Donna Gorski said. She and 3rd Ward Alderman Victor Wogen will begin door-knocking to recruit participants. The targeted neighborhood for the pilot program has about 200 residents, Gorski said. For more information on NICE, call the Public Works Planning and Zoning Division at 815-748-2060.",

    "sentence": "Body found in Kish River identified. A body found this weekend in the Kishwaukee River was identified Monday as that of a Wisconsin man last seen Christmas Day in DeKalb. The body of 56-year-old James C. Verduin was found about 2:45 p.m. Sunday in the river near Hopkins Park in DeKalb. Verduin was identified Monday during an autopsy, DeKalb County Coroner Dennis Miller said. Preliminary autopsy results show Verduin, a father of two from West Allis, Wis., drowned, Miller said. “We don’t suspect any foul play,” Miller said, adding there were no wounds, bruises or other marks on the body. “There was no sign of a struggle.” Miller said Verduin probably died Christmas Day or Dec. 26, and has been in the river since then. A couple walking their dog Sunday afternoon in Hopkins Park noticed the body floating face up in the water behind the 200 block of Joanne Lane, according to police reports. Police do not know where Verduin entered the water. “When you’re dealing with rivers, currents can certainly have a huge effect on where you’re going to find an object,” DeKalb Police Lt. Gary Spangler said. “He could have went into the river 100 yards of where we found him, he could have gone in by the hotel. We just don’t know.” Verduin’s body might have been stuck on something in the river, Spangler and Miller said, which is why it hadn’t been found until now. If that was the case, recent heavy rainfalls caused the river to swell and could have dislodged him, Spangler said. Authorities believe Verduin wandered into the river, Spangler said. “We are aware of some emotional issues that could have contributed to the death,” he added. The body of Verduin, who was found wearing only boxer shorts, was discolored but intact, according to police reports. Verduin “more than likely discarded the clothing before or while in the water,” Spangler said, but added that the clothing has not been found. Verduin was expected to attend a family gathering Dec. 27, but left a message for his family that he needed some time away by himself, his brother, Bill Verduin, told the Daily Chronicle in January. The family is not sure why he was in the DeKalb area on Christmas Day, when he was involved in a one-car accident on Interstate 88. Verduin declined treatment at the scene of the accident, according to police reports, but appeared a bit disoriented by people he came in contact with after the accident. Miller said Verduin showed no signs of head trauma. His family has said Verduin had diabetes. After his car crashed into a tollway truss, it was towed from the scene, and the tow truck driver dropped Verduin off at the Best Western DeKalb Inn & Suites, police said. Two days later, a hotel employee called Verduin’s family and asked them to pick up his belongings, noting that he had never checked out. The family called police, who searched the area around the hotel that night, police said. Several additional air and ground searches were conducted in the days and weeks following his disappearance. Phone messages left Monday with Verduin’s family members were not immediately returned.",

    "sentence": "Board appointments go forward aside from discussion. The appointment of residents volunteering to serve on Dublin's boards and commissions is usually a pretty uncomplicated procedure. However, a resolution for the appointments began a discussion among Dublin City Council members at their Monday, March 16 meeting regarding the appointment of a City Council member to the city's Planning and Zoning Commission. During the council's goal-setting retreat in February 2008, council members unanimously approved a motion to appoint a seventh citizen to a commission seat previously held by a council member, with plans to review the new process formally in January. Council members Michael Keenan, Rick Gerber and John Reiner, along with Mayor Marilee Chinnici-Zuercher and Vice Mayor Cathy Boring voted 'no' to Councilman Tim Lecklider's motion to not make the appointment to the planning and zoning commission until after discussion of the process, with Councilwoman Amy Salay joining Lecklider in voting 'yes.' \"We have had a tremendous workload,\" Chinnici-Zuercher said. \"When we made the decision to have this discussion in January, this decision was made before the resignation of our city manager, and our search for a new one. \"Boulder City Council offered then Dublin City Manager Jane Brautigam a position as its city manager Aug. 10, 2008. Her last day in the Dublin post was Sept. 26, 2008. The national search for a new city manager began Sept. 8, when City Council unanimously approved a motion to engage the services of Thomas Dority Sr., vice president of the Mercer Group, for the recruitment process. The result was the appointment of Terry Foegler as Dublin's city manager, and his first official day of work was Feb. 17. \"This discussion is important, but we have had to go to a second tier of consideration,\" Chinnici-Zuercher said, as she suggested council members discuss the commission issue in a committee of the whole meeting to be scheduled before September. \"It clearly needs to be discussed,\" Keenan said. Following City Council's disapproval of the motion to exclude the planning and zoning seat from the appointments, it unanimously approved the following appointments:* Chris Amorose Groomes and Flite Freimann, four-year terms on the Planning and Zoning Commission, expiring March 31, 2013. * Carl Karrer, three-year term on the Architectural Review Board as the Dublin Historical Society representative, and Robert Schisler, three-year term on the ARB as an Historic District merchant representative. Both terms expire March 31, 2012. * Victoria Newell and Brett Page, a three-year term for each on the Board of Zoning Appeals, expiring March 31, 2012. * Patrick Todoran, to the unexpired term of Keith Blosser on the Board of Zoning Appeals, a term which expires on March 31, 2010. * Christine Gawronski and Dona Givens, both reappointed to a three-year term on the Community Services Advisory Commission, expiring March 31, 2012. * Kevin Cooper, three-year term on the Community Services Advisory Commission, expiring on March 31, 2012. * Susan Burness, three-year term as the city representative to the Dublin Convention and Visitors Bureau Board, a term which expires on March 31, 2012. * Jamie Boff and David Cecutti, reappointed to three-year terms on the Parks and Recreation Advisory Commission, expiring March 31, 2012. * DeWayne Howard, three-year term on the Personnel Board of Review, a term which expires on March 31, 2012. \"I do not wish to vote 'no,' because of the balance of those folks who have been appointed,\" Lecklider said, as he cast his 'yes' vote. There is one remaining appointment to be made to the Architectural Review Board, and City Council hopes to complete this appointment at its April 6 meeting, Clerk of Council Anne Clarke said via e-mail Tuesday, March 17. Board and commission members will have an orientation and training session at 6:30 p.m. Monday, March 30 in Talla 2 at the Dublin Community Recreation Center, 5600 Post Road, Chinnici-Zuercher said.",

    "sentence": "Committee plans May benefit along with dedication. It may have seemed, at times, like it might never get there, but the Dublin Veterans Project is moving closer to its fundraising and dedication goal. \"We are 80 percent to our goal,\" project committee member Michael Kehoe said during Dublin City Council's regular session Monday, March 16. The committee has raised nearly $612,000 toward its goal of $790,000, he said, with eight of 25 trees designated in the sycamore grove section of the memorial. In 2006, Dublin City Council committed $250,000 to the project, with another $250,000 in funds to be raised by the Veterans Project fundraising committee. At the time, plans proposed to have the completed project's dedication on Veterans Day in 2007. But the project ran into obstacles when city staff learned in July 2007 that the total construction cost for the Grounds of Remembrance memorial was approaching, if not exceeding, $800,000. The cost overrun resulted in the Veterans Project committee unanimously approving a motion to allow project design firm Plant Architect Inc. of Toronto, Ontario, Canada a second chance to come back to the committee with a design for the Grounds of Remembrance project that would meet the original $500,000 budget. The project was designed to include an entry sign, a copper clad loggia, a memory wall, a dedication wall, walking path and associated site work, according to information from the city. City Council unanimously approved a resolution accepting a base bid of $478,840 from the McDaniel Construction Corp. as the lowest and best bid for the project in August 2008 and construction began shortly after. The project committee has a fundraiser, the Red, White and Blue Bash, scheduled for 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. May 1 at the Villas at Coffman Park, Kehoe said. Tickets are $300 each and include a dedication stone, he said. \"If they have already purchased a stone, we will offer another option,\" he said. The dedication of Grounds of Remembrance in Dublin Veterans Park is on track to take place Memorial Day, Monday, May 25, \"following the parade led by the VFW and American Legion,\" Kehoe said. \"You have all done an incredible job raising the funds and increasing awareness of this very important memorial,\" Dublin Mayor Marilee Chinnici-Zuercher said. In other council business, legislation was approved authorizing the city to enter into a pre-annexation agreement for 5,600 acres on the east side of Hyland-Croy Road at 8600 Hyland-Croy Road in Jerome Township, in order to obtain city water and sewer services. Legislation amending the annual appropriations ordinance for the fiscal year ending Dec. 31, 2009, also was approved. In addition, council approved a resolution allowing the city to enter into an agreement allowing the operation of a Subway restaurant in the Dublin Community Recreation Center. The city previously had a lease agreement with TehKu Tea Co. TehKu ceased operations at the center in August 2008 due to its inability to prosper, according to information from the city. \"We learned a lot from that experience,\" Dublin Recreation Services Director Matt Earman said. Following a patron survey conducted by city staff, Subway was found to meet the primary criteria of providing prompt service for all menu options, a variety of healthy food options, and a business strategy with proven success inside a recreation center similar to the DCRC -- the Natatorium in Cuyahoga Falls, he said. The estimated timeframe for full operation at the DCRC is eight to 12 weeks, according to information from the city. The center's restaurant will include breakfast sandwiches as well as the full Subway menu. Council adjourned to a closed session for discussion of legal, land acquisition and personnel matters, according to information from the city, at the request of Dublin City Manager Terry Foegler.",

    "sentence": "Dublin students getting a kick out of Martial Arts classes. Students from several Dublin elementary schools don't have to rely on action television shows to get a dose of martial arts before school in the morning. Instead they come to school early to study with Master Greg Fears, a retired police officer and veteran competitor on the world martial arts stage. Fears teaches children and adults at the Ernie Reyes' World Martial Arts School in Carriage Place, but he said coming to the schools to work with students is a welcome addition. \"It's refreshing -- just to know that you can have an impact in their lives,\" he said. Fears' classes at Glacier Ridge, Deer Run and Thomas elementary schools emphasize more than kicks and punches. He also tries to reinforce what parents are teaching their kids, he said, including respect and life skills. \"When you hear it from more than one person, it ends up sinking in,\" he said. Glacier Ridge third-grader Adam Alkire said Fears taught his class \"that we're to help people and not start fights. \"Alkire just completed his third four-week session with Fears and earned his Little Dragon Red Belt. Allison Jennings is also a third-grader at Glacier Ridge. She said Fears taught her and her classmates that respect and concentration are important. Jennings put her concentration to good use to break a board into three pieces with her hand at the conclusion of the final class. \"I was, like, amazed,\" she said about the two breaks she made in the board. Each of the 18 students in the Glacier Ridge class took on -- and broke -- the board, with family members looking on and classmates watching in respectful silence. Fears said each student had to choose whether or not to try to break the board. \"You feel more confident that you've overcome that obstacle,\" he said. \"The point is not to see if you can break the board,\" he told students. \"The point is to empower yourself. \"Students kept the pieces of their broken boards, as well as their new colored belts. The martial arts clubs are open to elementary school students of all ages, said Heather Heinz, the Glacier Ridge PTO martial arts coordinator. Glacier Ridge offers the program twice per year. The club helps students by introducing them to the world of martial arts, providing a means of self-defense and developing self-confidence and character, Heinz said. It also offers physical benefits, including enhancing conditioning, flexibility, agility and coordination, she said. Fears said the Thomas club still had three weeks remaining in its current session, and then the clubs will be finished for the current school year.",

    "sentence": "Name gameCouncil is considering street name changes. Wichita Street or Wichita Drive? Dublin City Council heard a first reading on legislation to change the name of the street during its regular meeting Monday, March 16. Dublin Director of Engineering Paul Hammersmith said a discrepancy in what residents believe is the street name after it was brought to the attention of city staff by the Franklin County Auditor's Office. The city issued addresses for Wichita Street Dec. 16, 1986. Records indicate the majority of residents are using Wichita Drive instead of Wichita Street, according to information from the city. \"We think the developer installed street signs showing Wichita Drive, and that the posted sign is why the residents use 'Drive' instead of 'Street,' \" Hammersmith said. \"Folks moved in, started using Wichita Drive and that is where we are at today,\" he said. Hammersmith said letters were sent to the nine residents regarding the change, and that city staff has not heard back from them. \"The post office and 9-1-1 said everybody is using Wichita Drive,\" he said. \"It should be a simple change, which we will take care of at out next meeting,\" April 6, Mayor Marilee Chinnici-Zuercher said. Council also heard a first reading of legislation to change the name of a section of Darby Street in Historic Dublin to North Street. Darby Street currently originates on Bridge Street between the Dublin Veterinary Clinic, 32 W. Bridge St., and the BriHi site, and ends on High Street, south of the Dublin Branch of the Columbus Metropolitan Library, 75 N. High St.Proceeding north on Darby from Bridge Street, Darby Street makes a 90-degree turn to the east in front of the library, and causes confusion because the street intersects both Bridge and High Streets and runs both north-south and east-west, according to information from the city. \"We know this is actually called Darby Street, and that is part of the problem,\" Hammersmith said. Changing the name of the section running east-west in front of the library from Darby to North Street will also help meet one of the goals of the Historic Dublin wayfaring project -- to make visitors comfortable and confident while visiting the district, according to information from the city. Both the city and engineering departments support the change, there are no addresses to be renamed, and the library and the Blarney Brothers Ltd., adjoining property owners, have not expressed concerns regarding the proposed change. \"Some things do work in our favor,\" Hammersmith said. A second reading and vote on the legislation is expected during Council's regular meeting April 6.",

The decision was not unexpected. Two weeks ago, the board named Derrer as the sole finalist for the position. A 14-day period of review followed the announcement, in which the public could comment on Derrer's selection. Derrer is the fifth person to hold the spot since 2004. The position pays the same as his interim post, $130,000 per year, with a one-year severance should he leave. Derrer's job does not fall under the protection of the civil service board, a three-member panel that determines employee appeals. One added benefit to Derrer's contract as county manager is that the county will pay 100 percent of his health insurance. His government experience runs deep. A veteran of Hall County government, he retired in December 2007 after more than 25 years of service. He opted to take early retirement from Hall, but felt he \"still had a lot of energy left, and I feel like I still have a lot to offer the community.\" Months after retiring from Hall, he joined Forsyth as deputy county manager. He was elevated to the interim county manager spot after Rhonda Poston-O'Connor was fired as county manager in September 2008.",

Frank Buck Zoo is inviting all of its friends, new and old, to join them in celebrating Frank “Bring ‘Em Back Alive” Buck’s birthday on March 17. Frank Howard Buck was born in Gainesville on March 17, 1884. As a child Buck was fascinated by all kinds of animals and loved to study school geography books filled with exotic names of far-off places, said Frank Buck Zoo Director Susan Kleven in an e-mail sent to the Register. In 1911, she added, Buck began his 24 year career in the business of collecting animals for exhibit. “At a time when ‘big game hunting’ abroad was a popular pastime of the wealthy, Frank Buck concentrated on capturing and preserving the world’s wildlife,” said Kleven. “Buck abhorred the senseless slaughter of animals. His efforts play a large role in making American’s aware of how important it is to conserve the vast treasure that is our native wildlife. ”“During his career, Buck placed many animals into environments in which they could breed and propagate without the threat of extinction. Thus, Frank Buck was one of the first wildlife conservationist at a time when conservation was a sadly neglected matter.” In honor of Buck’s birthday, zoo admission will be a buck a head ($1) during Tuesday, March 17 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.Visitors will also be able to explore the world’s only Frank Buck Exhibit located in the zoo’s gift shop. Cake will also be available while it lasts. Frank Buck Zoo is located at 1000 W. California Street. For more information, please call 668-4539 or visit the online website at www.frankbuckzoo.com.",

    "sentence": "Gulf-war vet to bike from Norman to D.C.. He’s a long way from home. His arms are aching and a warm shower would feel good. But Kevin George Baker can’t complain. His mission is at stake. Sipping a Sprite during a stop at Gainesville’s VFW Post No. 1922,, Baker, almost 40, talked about his plan to ride a bicycle from his hometown of Norman, Okla. to Washington D.C.Peddling a custom built hand crank bicycle, the disabled Gulf War veteran knew he would be among friends when he saw Gainesville VFW Post No. 1922 in the distance. “I saw the VFW and I thought, “Thank God,” Baker said. The purpose of his journey is simple. He’d like to deliver an Honor and Remember flag to President Barack Obama. Honor and Remember is a nationwide project to bring recognition to American veterans. The organization’s mission is, according to its Web site, “to establish and promote a nationally recognized flag that would fly continuously as a visible reminder to all Americans of the lives lost in defense of our national freedoms. All Military lives lost not only in action but also in service, from our nation's inception.” Baker doesn’t have an invitation to visit the White House, but hopes the president will allow him inside, just for a moment. “I’m hoping President Obama will open the gates for me,” Baker said, smiling. He’s a likable guy who looks younger than he is. He’s quick to talk about his progress and even quicker to listen to the words of others. He never gets tired of telling strangers why he’s riding a bike to D.C.And strangers like to talk to him. Most have one main concern — Baker’s safety. “They ask me if I’m all right,” he said. Baker is not easy to miss with his trio of flags -- an American flag, a Soldier’s Angels flag and an Honor and Remember flag and his belongings strapped neatly to his bicycle and small bike trailer. It isn’t easy to peddle the custom built bicycle, especially for a man with a disability. An enemy attack while serving in a naval firefighting unit in the first Gulf War left him with severe neurological damage. As a result, he can stand only with assistance. But using his shoulders, arms and hands he can peddle a bike like nobody’s business. “I may end up looking like the Incredible Hulk when I get back,” Baker said, “All that upper body strength.” He got the idea to start his journey during a tough time in his life. He was battling cancer -- a result, he said, of Gulf War syndrome, a set of troubling symptoms which include neurological disorders and several types of cancer. The U.S. Defense Department denies the existence of Gulf War syndrome but Baker is certain his time in Iraq, breathing the contaminated air from hundreds of Saddam Hussein‘s burning oil facilities, caused his cancer. The disease may even be the reason Baker chose to make the trip. “In December, I was going through chemo and I thought this might be the last time I can do something like this so I may as well try it,” he said. He left his Norman home Saturday, March 7 according to www.honorandremember.org.His plan on Monday was to stop for a while in Gainesville before heading on to Sherman where he had decided to spend the night in a camp ground. Baker brought along the things he figured he would require during the 15-week trip -- about 150 pounds of gear including camping supplies. He tries to plan his stops so that he ends up at public campgrounds. Other times, he stays at hotels or motels. On a good day with calm winds and fair weather, he said he can do 50 miles a day. Some days, like Monday, are more difficult with relentless winds that make peddling a challenge. “I was lucky to get 40 miles in today,” he said. He’s also met some kindred spirits on the trip. “My first day out, I peddled 48 miles and was through for the day. I stopped at a Shell gas station where I met a husband and wife. They were both veterans, and they ended up asking me to stay the night with them,” he said. He admits the ride to Washington is one of the greatest challenges of his life. Baker said he isn’t even sure he’ll make it the entire 1,500 miles. “I’m not thoroughly sure I can do this, but I tell myself every day that I can and so far, I’ve kept on going,” he said. He isn’t afraid he’ll become too ill to continue the ride, he said. “Riding this bicycle makes me feel stronger. I’ve been sick for 11 years, but I’m gonna be okay,” he said. Baker said he isn’t riding for his own recognition. He’s riding for all the men and women who have fought and are still fighting in wars that most people don’t spend too much time thinking about. And there’s another, more basic reason for his ride. “I love my country,” he said. To follow Kevin George Baker’s journey see www.honorandremember.org.",

    "sentence": "TxDOT puts FM 678 overpass on project list. It could take a few years, but residents of Cooke County are hopeful a new Texas Department of Transportation construction project will help make a dangerous Highway 82 intersection safer. TxDOT reportedly approved a request to fund an overpass running east and west over Farm to Market 678 on U.S. Highway 82, said Commissioner Gary Hollowell. Hollowell said the resolution is the combined efforts of a number of concerned citizens as well as members of the commissioners court. A group of commissioners wrote the resolution and presented it to TxDOT at least two years ago, Hollowell said. “We’ve attended meetings at (TxDOT’s district office) in Wichita Falls where we met with a nonbinding resolution committee. We provided TxDOT with a wish list of projects we would like to see completed. The list is prioritized, but TxDOT is not obligated to do it (the projects),” he said. He said county judges and representatives of municipalities often appeal for projects they believe are important. The overpass at 678 was apparently a priority for many, Hollowell said, citing efforts by county commissioners, Cooke County residents and others including Callisburg Independent School District Superintendent Dr. Charles Holloway to get the project started. “The justification for the project are the accidents and near-accidents at this intersection,” he said. The project is also the result of investigation and research by TxDOT officials. “TxDOT spent time doing traffic studies and installing warning indicators (at the intersection),” he said. “They also increased the number of turn lanes and added exceleration lanes and striping to try to highlight the area.” The project is not scheduled to begin immediately. “We think it will be let in 2010 or 2012,” Hollowell said. For many, the project cannot begin soon enough. “The sooner, the better,” he said. The FM 678 and Highway 82 project is one of at least construction projected slated to take place in Cooke County. The 678 project is expected to be paid for by surety bond funds. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (2009 Stimulus bill) is reportedly funding two addition projects. These projects include a resurfacing of portions of Interstate Highway 35 from Highway 82 to the Red River and widening FM 2071 between FM 372 and FM 922.",

    "sentence": "Local business owners optimistic. On some mornings, the line at the Mom’s Donut Shop drive-through window is four or five cars long, and the small building is filled with families and individuals gazing at the sweet treats through the glass display cases while employees pack the goodies into neat white boxes. Even in tough economic times people still like a treat now and then. Mom’s Donut owner Cindy Davidson — who operates the donut business with her husband, Chris — said things haven’t been all good, but they are not dismal. “January was real rough,” Davidson said in a telephone interview Friday, “January is always a rough time for us because people are dieting and have spent a lot of money at Christmas, but things are picking up. This week which was spring break has been real good. We’ve seen a lot of faces that we don’t normally see.” The Davidsons are part of a fairly large number of Gainesville business owners and operators who say they are not only surviving, they are thriving even in a bad economy. Some business owners choose to improve the look of their stores. Gainesville’s Tom Thumb supermarket, which is owned by the California-based Safeway corporation, recently revamped its store on Grand Avenue. The changes are part of the company’s plan to make shopping a bit easier for customers, said Connie Yates a spokesman for the company. The renovated Tom Thumb store was set up using the company’s lifestyle concept, she noted. “We are in the process of remodeling all of our stores in Texas to have the lifestyles format,” she said. The store is organized in more a customer-friendly way with lots of similar items grouped together. “We want to have one-stop shopping for our customers in an atmosphere that they can enjoy shopping in,” she said. The store renovations are part of that plan. “We are very proud of our newly remodeled store in Gainesville and are doing everything we can using special sales and discount opportunities for our customers.” Food is one requirement that cannot be ignored, she said. “I have heard the grocery industry referred to as an essential industry. People have to eat,” Yates said. A handful of Gainesville companies chose to settle in new locations. Curves, a local fitness facility, is set to move to a new office complex on Grand Avenue. Owner Judy Waskow said after some difficult times late last year, her company seems to be recovering quickly. “The end of the year was not good at all,” Waskow admitted. “But January and February have started out well.” She said although the move to the new building was essential — the building where Curves is located was sold over a year ago — the new location is a larger facility which she believes both current and future members will enjoy. Working out is a passion for many residents, she added. “There’s a good bunch (of members) that work out regularly,” she said. She also said the economic picture isn’t perfect, but it isn’t all bleak. “I’m optimistic,” she said. Another Gainesville business set to move to new, larger digs is Landmark Bank. Landmark Bank Chief Executive Officer Basil Bigbie said the company has experienced “steady growth in the north central Texas (Texoma) area. ”“Providing our customers with access to new facilities along the Highway 82 corridor east into Gainesville and Lindsay was a natural progression for the bank,” Bigbie said in an e-mail message. He also said the decision to open new facilities in this area came after a lot of thought and preparation. “The planning, strategy and allocation of resources for these two facilities was in place well before the recent economic events. We’re excited to be moving forward with these two new banking centers and have already received a lot of positive feedback from the Gainesville and Lindsay communities,” Bigbie noted. Local automobile dealerships faced a year when most major auto manufacturers reported huge losses. But a representative for one Gainesville-area dealership said business is not bad at all. Glenn Polk AutoPlex is posting sales and service numbers that are equal to 2007, which, a press release says, was a fantastic year. They attribute their success to repeat and referral business. “Although lot traffic has slowed a bit, we still have a steady stream of our previous customers coming in, and referrals of their friends and relatives,” said owner Glenn Polk. “Not only are we proud of our hard work and the success that we have had in Cooke County, but we are proud to be a part of the American auto industry. We are excited to be a part of Ford Motor Company and Chrysler,” Polk added. According to Polk’s son, Trent, the company also employees approximately 60 people and has contributed almost $200,000 in donations, fundraisers and sponsorships. “Glenn Polk AutoPlex averages between 125-150 new and used vehicle sales every month. Since opening in April of 1995, we have sold over 22,000 here in Gainesville. These kinds of numbers are equal to dealerships you’d find in a big city,” Trent Polk said. Like other business owners, the Polks said they encourage residents to shop local businesses. “We encourage folks to do business local. Keeping the money here in Gainesville is very important to the growth of our community,” Trent Polk concluded. Auto dealer James Wood is another businessman who sees the potential in Gainesville. Wood recently made a deal to purchase Brown Motor Company. “We’ve been looking to put in a finance lot in Gainesville because it’s such a good trade area,” Wood said in a March 4 Register story. Wood said he believes the dealership will be larger than Brown Motor Company.",

    "sentence": "Flying Tiger bids Gainesville goodbye. Heading into the sky over Gainesville, the restored P-40 Curtiss Warhawk climbed and turned into the wind after 2-years of restoration to join the Commemorative Air Force (CAF) tours in Texas and Florida. Ray Kinney flew the Warhawk. Kinney, one of the owners of the Circuit Breaker Sales (CBS) Hanger at the airport, flew in to pick up the plane. After meeting with friends who helped to restore the World War II (WW II) aircraft, the pilot checked out the P-40 Curtiss Warhawk. Kinney donned his leather flying helmet, taxied up the runway and then flew over the airport several times before tipping the aircraft wings several times in salute, and roaring off toward his destinaiton. CBS was one of the main sponsors for the renovation of the P-40 Curtiss Warhawk, the plane made famous in WW II. Kinney said “I’ve been in love with aviation all my life. On Jan. 19, 1967, right after I graduated from North Texas, I went straight to the airport and bought some aviation lessons. ”“I was in the Navy flying aircraft after submarines in early Vietnam,” said Kinney. “For me, this is just about as good as it gets, flying the P-40 Curtiss Warhawk.” said KinneyThe U.S. Air Force Fact sheet on the craft says the P-40 Curtiss Warhawk served in numerous combat areas during the war, including the Southwest Pacific, the Aleutian Islands, the Far East, the Middle East, Italy and some went to Russia. Though other aircraft often outperformed them in speed, maneuverability and rate of climb, the P-40 earned a reputation in battle for extreme ruggedness. According to historians, before the U.S. entered WW II, many U.S. volunteer pilots flew for China, Canada, Britian and the Soviet Union. A group of them — reads the web site www.flyingtigersavg.com — helped China as the country struggled against Japan and the American Volunteer Group of the Chinese army became known as the Flying Tigers and flew under the command of Gen. Clair Channault. Their P-40s were painted with the Chinese stars on the tops and bottoms of each wing, to identify the plane as a war ally and not an enemy plane. When the Warhawk left the CBS hanger, it was a replication of the Texan Flying Tiger Tex Hill’s plane. His name and war battle scorecard are painted on the left side of the plane. The Flying Tiger logo and the “Flying Panda’s (one group of the Flying Tigers) are also painted on the plane as well as the Chinese stars . “I had a long, wonderful history with Tex Hill,” said Kinney. “He was as sharp a man as you could ever meet, even well into his 90’s.” Kinney said that he has a real connection with these WW II pilots. “The men who flew them were the age of my father,” said Kinney. “I met a lot of them personally.” Aircraft and Engine Mechanic Larry Lange was the primary mechanic and had the responsibility of overseeing the whole restoration of the P-40 Curtiss Warhawk at the CBS Hangar. Machinists Norb Mages of Lindsay and Dennis Lopez of Thackerville, Okla. came to see the plane off. Both worked on the airplane and oversaw projects that involved retrofitting and overhauling. “This has been a great experience,” said Mages. “We’ve been doing this off and on for two years. ”“We’re fortunate to be a part of it,” said Lopez. “There are a lot of things that go through the machine shop but this takes the cake.” Lange said that Mark Zello, owner of “Flying Colors,” was responsible for painting the plane, including the famous shark teeth. Retired pilot Mike Cavanagh came by to see the Warhawk off. “I think every pilot is proud of Ray Kinney, the P-40 Curtiss Warhawk, and the work that Larry did,” said Cavanagh. “I would just come in and enviously watch it,” said Cavanagh. “I just watched it being put together, like a painting.” To learn more about the CAF, how to become involved with WWII aircraft, or to find the groups touring schedule, go to www.commemorativeairforce.org.",

    "sentence": "Dog-nappers hit Lindsay area. Jerry Hughes bought his dog in Caddo, Okla. and he called him Okie. Now Hughes —a 72-year old Cooke County resident — is having a hard time understanding why a brazen group stopped and picked up the eight month old dog. “I can’t believe they just drove up to my yard and took my dog,” Hughes said. This isn’t the first time Hughes and his wife have lost pets. He said a few years ago he had two other dogs. One of them was a cherished pet named Heck who he found on his doorstep one Christmas Day. “Me and my wife were sitting in the house and we heard this whimpering noise and I wondered what in the world it was. We went outside and there was little dog in a box. Hughes said he joked with his wife about getting rid of the tiny puppy. “But I would never do anything like that,” he said. Hughes said he and his wife fed the foundling with a bottle. “He was just a baby,” he said. Heck grew up and Hughes said he developed a bond with his dog. “He was special. He was really special,” he said. The other dog was a sweet Jack Russell terrier. But Heck was special. Heck had a habit of stopping by while Hughes was sitting in a chair in his living room. One day the dog walked up to his owner and lingered by the chair. The dog seemed uneasy or scared. At first, Hughes said he didn’t realize anything was wrong. “I thought he wanted me to pet him,” he said. “So I petted his chest. He always liked me to pet him like this, “ he said, reaching out with his arm. Heck suddenly slumped at his feet. “He died in my arms,” Hughes recalled, his eyes full of sorrow. Outside, he found the couple’s Jack Russell stretched out on the ground, also dead. “He was stiff, you know. He’d been there a while,” Hughes said. He believes both dogs were poisoned. The latest incident finds Hughes grieving all over again. He said the crime was hard to comprehend. Two cars drove past his house and Okie - who was a friendly dog — just jumped into one of the cars. “All they had to do was whistle and he got right in the car,” he said. He said he didn’t get a good look at the car’s occupants and still cannot describe them. “I just watched them take my dog. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing,” he said. His first concern was that the thieves might hurt Okie. “Then I realized they weren’t going to do anything to him. They took him because they wanted him,” he said. Hughes also said he knows there isn’t much anyone can do. “I called the Lindsay Police and I talked to a (Cooke County) deputy that came out, but I don’t think they can do anything,” he said. “I just had to tell somebody.”",

    "sentence": "Rodeo Gainesville looking for queen, princess candidates. Area girls from Cooke, Grayson and Love counties will get the chance to be the first ever queen and princess for Rodeo Gainesville. The Gainesville Riding Club will host Rodeo Gainesville during May 7-9 at the Gainesville Riding Club Arena. Known as rodeo royalty, the queen and princess candidates will be judged on two separate divisions: tickets sales and a riding pattern. Sixty percent of the girls overall score will be based upon their ticket sales, said Whitney Lemons, rodeo queen/princess coordinator. The other 40 percent, will be scored from a riding pattern the girls will be given before the rodeo. “The riding pattern has not yet been released,” said Lemons. “We won’t release that until two weeks before hand, maybe even a week until the rodeo in order to give them a little bit of time to get familiar with it and to practice. At the same time, we don’t want to give the girls enough time to practice it everyday because we want to know how they work under pressure and on the spot.” Queen candidates must be between the ages of 14-18 and princess candidates must be between the ages of 10-13, added Lemons. All candidates must have their own horse, have never been married or have any children and must have permission to compete from a legal guardian. Prizes for the crowned queen and princess will include a trophy saddle and other prizes to be donated by local merchants such as a belt buckle and sash. The girls will have six weeks to sell tickets, said Lemons. Ticket sales will begin Monday, March 28. However the deadline to apply for queen or princess has been extended through Friday, April 3. Interested girls can receive an application for queen or princess at Landmark Bank in Gainesville, 1110 E California Street; American Bank in Whitesboro, 851 Highway 377 N; or by contacting Lemons at (940) 736-8059. As part of the application process, Lemons said the girls will have to complete a short questionnaire to give the judges an idea of each candidate’s personality. The winning queen and princess will get to ride nightly in the Rodeo Gainesville as part of the grand entry, said Lemons. Not only will they be featured nightly, but a special crowning will take place during Friday night’s performance. The girls will also get the chance to ride and participate throughout the year as Rodeo Gainesville’s queen and princess at other rodeos and parades of their choice. While the competition should be taken seriously, said Lemons, the main goal for the queen and princess competition is to give area cowgirls a moment to shine and to have fun. “We’re pretty easy going,” said Lemons. “We want to make it something that anybody can participate in. You don’t have to be in the horse industry as far as showing or having real high-end horses. We just want it to be something that someone who has a horse for every day riding can compete in and to give all the young cowgirls in the counties a chance to compete.” Lemons, who was the Gainesville Chamber of Commerce Rodeo Queen in 2001, described her experience as rodeo royalty as a great honor. “It is a great thing to be involved in and a great honor to hold,” said Lemons. “The best advice I can give to girls competing, I would have to say, is to just work your ticket sales and know your riding pattern. You just really got to work for it but it’s worth it.”",

    "sentence": "No one injured in Newberry home invasion. A shot fired into the floor during a home invasion robbery in Newberry on Friday night may have been accidental, according to Alachua County Sheriff’s Office deputies. The incident began at 11:05 p.m. in a home in the 25400 block of SW 2nd Ave. The homeowner said he was inside his home a minute or so when four men forced their way into the home. Deputies said a woman who was a friend of the homeowner was also in the house at the time. The man and the woman told deputies that four masked men, including one carrying a gun, forced them to lie on the kitchen floor. The man said that when the intruders demanded money, he told them he did not have a safe or cash in his home. Instead, the masked men took cash and credit cards from the man’s pockets along with his cell phone. “Apparently he was not lying still enough and the suspect with the gun fired a round that went through the kitchen floor,” said sheriff’s spokesman Art Forgey. After the gun went off, the intruders talked among themselves, saying that a shooting was not a part of the plan and asking the shooter why he had fired the weapon. “That makes us believe it may have been accidental,” Forgey said. “And they picked up the man and the woman from the kitchen floor to make sure they were not hurt before they made them get back down onto the floor.” Before the men left the home, they also grabbed jewelry and a laptop computer from the bedroom of the homeowners’ daughter, who was not at home at the time of the incident. Witnesses told deputies they saw a white, police-type sedan in the area shortly before the home invasion. The victims told deputies that the four men were similar in appearance  all were black men, about 5-9 to 5-10 with thin builds and about 20 years old. All four were wearing ski masks and were dressed in dark clothing, including baggy jeans and jackets. Anyone with information about the home invasion is asked to contact the Sheriff’s Office at 955-1818.",

George, 46. A few items found at George’s apartment and the items in the white bag McDonald had been carrying matched the descriptions of the items taken from the condominium.

Off-duty officers from three agencies were called in early Saturday to break up a Chiefland bar brawl that turned into a street fight involving as many as 200 people. Chiefland Police Chief Robert Douglas said his officers were called to Knucklehead’s Bar at about 1:30 a.m. Saturday to break up a fight that had moved to the parking lot. The first officers on the scene called for backup immediately due to the size of the brawl and then waited for additional officers from the police department, the Levy County Sheriff’s Office, the Florida Highway Patrol and all off-duty officers in the area to arrive. “Even with all that manpower, it took about 30 minutes to remove the crowd and break up all the fights,” Douglas said. He characterized the participants as mostly men in the 20s and 30s, with most from the Chiefland or Cross City areas. A motive for the fighting had not been established by Monday morning. “We have had some fights at that bar, but none this big,” Douglas said. “We aren’t sure what started this, but when we got there the majority of the fighting was in the parking lot where there were guys swinging bar stools. Some officers were hit in the head. It was a street fight.” One man was arrested, although others could have been charged for a variety of offenses, officials said. “As the fights were broken up, people ran off and that is something we will be addressing for future events,” Douglas said.",

The stabbing victim was taken to the hospital while the man accused of knifing him went to jail. The incident happened at about 4:30 a.m. Saturday in the Hardeetown area of Chiefland. Police Chief Robert Douglas said Stephen Davis, of Chiefland, had been arguing with Michael Durr, of Trenton. “Witnesses told our officers that Davis tried to walk away, but Durr continued taunting him, and it got physical when Durr hit him (Davis) with a closed fist,” Douglas said. Witnesses said Durr pulled out a knife with a black handle and a four- to five-inch-long blade that he used to stab Davis four times. Davis was taken to a Gainesville hospital for treatment of a punctured lung and other injuries. Durr fled from the scene and reportedly headed to a house outside Chiefland where he had been living with his girlfriend and their baby, parking the BMW he had been driving in the garage. Levy County sheriff's Deputy Mark Morgan was dispatched to the home Saturday morning because a fire had been reported there. Sheriff’s spokesman Capt. Evan Sullivan said the State Fire Marshal's Office sent investigators to the scene because local firefighters believed the fire was suspicious. Durr was arrested a short time later and charged with aggravated battery.",

According to court records, Servance was alone with Markel when the baby stopped breathing. Servance reportedly gave police at least two versions of what happened to Markel. An autopsy showed there was blunt-force trauma to the baby’s head, which caused the internal bleeding that resulted in death. Acting Circuit Judge Mary Day Coker sentenced Servance to 15 years in prison to be followed by 24 months of probation and also ordered him to attend anger management classes. Markel’s mother chose not to make a statement during sentencing.",

Toting signs that said “Vote no on 1” and “Equality for all,” about 55 Gainesville residents marched Friday near the intersection of Northwest Eighth Avenue and Northwest 34th Street. The protesters opposed Charter Amendment 1, which would remove Gainesville’s existing discrimination protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity, said Shelbi Day, a marcher and the director of communications and media for Equality is Gainesville’s Business, which opposes the amendment. The march, which went along Northwest 8th Avenue for about 15 minutes followed by a signholding demonstration at the intersection, included Gainesville parents, children, church members, faculty and students. Day said the march aimed to let locals know that Gainesville says “no” to discrimination. On the other hand, Micanopy resident Troy Blakely, who held a sign in favor of the amendment near the Supervisor of Elections Office during early voting on Saturday, said the amendment should be passed because it represents a public safety issue and would protect against sexual predators. Art Ellingsen, a Gainesville resident and a member of the proamendment group Citizens for Good Public Policy, referenced the group’s commercial depicting a man entering a women’s restroom. He said he worries about the safety of his baby granddaughter when she visits him if the amendment does not pass. Tamara Cohen, the director of multicultural and diversity affairs at UF and a member of the march, said she cares about issues of sexual violence and that is not what her fight against the amendment is about. “It’s about protecting Gainesville as an inclusive, welcoming city,” she said. Zoe Falcone, a transgender UF botany senior and a march participant, planned to go to graduate school at UF but will leave if the amendment is passed. “It would be just bad for our reputation and bad for our city and bad for the university,” Falcone said. After spending about 30 minutes at the Northwest Eighth Avenue and Northwest 34th Street intersection, about 15 demonstrators drove to the corner of Northwest 13th Street and Northwest 16th Avenue to continue holding their signs and listening for the occasional horn honks from passing cars.",

The citywide election will take place on Tuesday and voters may cast ballots at their precinct polling places between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. Her office received many calls during the week from students asking if voters had to vote on all ballot issues and candidates, or if they could just choose one, she said. “You can vote for just one, or as many issues or candidates as you want,” she said. Carpenter believed invigoration from the presidential elections last fall may also have played a role in student participation. “I would like to think that some of our younger voters came to realize how important it is to participate in democracy,” she said.",

    "sentence": "Beers, sofas, TVs found in St. Marys River. St. Marys — The 130-mile St. Marys River is among the nation’s cleanest waterways, but not everyone cares. Although most people appreciate the St. Marys for its serenity and unspoiled beauty, beer drinkers have found another use for the river — as a dumping ground for their empties. Dean Woehrle, co-chairman of the St. Marys River Management Committee, estimates about 60 percent of the trash picked up each year during the St. Marys River Celebration is discarded beer bottles. Considering volunteers have pulled more than 500,000 pounds of trash from the river and its tributaries since the first cleanup in 1997, that’s a lot of empties. Woehrle believes the ratio of empties to other trash will remain the same when as many as 850 volunteers from Camden and Charlton counties in Georgia and Nassau and Baker counties in Florida participate in today’s cleanup. Of course, beer bottles aren’t the only trash pulled from the river each year. Past cleanups have turned up items such as couches, air conditioners, bowling balls, vehicle parts and refrigerators, stoves and other large appliances. Charlton County manager Steve Nance said he doesn’t understand why people dump household furnishings in the river, because the county picks up those items at no extra charge on trash collection days.",

    "sentence": "State legislator sponsors bill for his industry. A state House leader is sponsoring a bill this session that would make it easier for his industry to sell houses. State Rep. Jay Roberts (R-Ocilla), chairman of the House Majority Caucus, is pushing HB 516, which would prohibit Georgia communities from putting restrictions on modular homes, which are built off-site at a factory. Roberts is a manager at Georgia Modular Systems, of Fitzgerald, a maker of manufactured homes, duplexes and townhouses. The lawmaker said he doesn’t consider working on the issue a conflict of interest. “I don’t own a plant, but I do work in a plant,” he said. “I’ve thought about it, but nobody understands this issue. Nobody understands this business.” He said his company does not sell many houses in Georgia. On his financial disclosure form, Roberts lists himself as an employee of Georgia Modular Systems. In an interview Friday, Roberts would not specify his position at the company, only saying he worked “in management.” He previously was a vice president at another modular-home business. Only a few Georgia cities, including Gainesville and Duluth, have zoning rules that restrict modular homes, but the issue has come up across the United States. Roberts’ legislation stems from a legal battle that arose in 2005, when Gainesville officials stopped a local modular-home builder from finishing several homes in the city. Grant Smerecznsky, owner of Building Systems Network LLC, sued, and the issue is pending in the courts. He approached Roberts and Steve Snyder, executive director of the Modular Building Systems Association in Harrisburg, Pa. Smerecznsky said he has never used Roberts’ company as a supplier, but he would if he had the chance. He said he does not think Roberts is serving his own interests with the bill. He said Roberts is simply standing up for an industry that he believes is being discriminated against by some communities because they think modular means mobile homes. “He’s doing what an elected official should do,” Smerecznsky said. “He’s doing something for the people.” Gainesville Mayor Myrtle Figueras would not comment, citing the court case. Councilman Danny Dunagan also said he could not comment on the case, but said of the bill, “I have a real problem with a legislator pushing legislation that directly affects his business. I think that’s kind of unethical.” Rick Thompson, executive secretary of the Georgia State Ethics Commission, said nothing in the state Ethics-in-Government act prohibits a lawmaker from submitting legislation related to his own business. Snyder said he called Roberts to talk to him about the issue. Asked in an interview who lobbied for the issue, Snyder said, “I did.” Thompson said lobbyists for an industry “are required to register and report if they undertake to promote or oppose legislation.” Told about this later, Synder said he initially misspoke. He said he talked with Roberts and provided him copies of similar legislation in other states, but he did not come to Georgia and lobby. Snyder is not registered to lobby in Georgia. Snyder said he was thinking of flying down for debate on the bill last week, but he decided not to because, “I thought this whole thing was taken care of.” Asked about Roberts pushing a bill affecting his business, Snyder said, “I get that, but there is nothing diabolical here. I need a legislator who understands our industry. He said he’d be happy to do it.” Synder said Roberts “really did a great job for us. I would hate to see this guy get mud on him.” Roberts’ bill has passed out of the House and is now under consideration in the Senate. Just before it passed, however, opponents of the bill submitted an amendment that weakens its authority over local zoning. The change, Snyder said, “makes the bill worthless to us.” Roberts said he is now trying to change it back in the Senate. Al Outland, spokesman for the Georgia Municipal Association, said the group was concerned the bill would overrule local zoning, but the amendment allayed their concerns. If the amendment stands, the organization is neutral on the bill, he said. Roberts isn’t the only lawmaker to introduce legislation this session about his own industry. Rep. Clay Cox (R-Lilburn) filed legislation to limit oversight of the private probation business. He is CEO of a large private probation company. After The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote about the bill, Cox pulled it and said he is reworking it.",

    "sentence": "New Gainesville prison clashes with revitalization. A new detention facility planned for the heart of its Midtown district has some Gainesville officials wringing their hands. The city, in talks with Hall County and Corrections Corporation of America, wants to insure that the new prison, which will house up to 502 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees, meets its idea of urban revitalization. The city began a project 10 years ago to clean up the rundown area and invested $250,000 in a study to map out a revitalization strategy, said City Councilman Danny Dunagan. Nashville-based CCA signed a five-year agreement to lease the old county jail from Hall County to operate the center on Main Street. The 20-year lease, with two 5-year renewals, will pay Hall County $2 million annually. “The last thing we want in downtown for 20 years is a prison,” Dunagan said. The city has invested a lot in its Midtown revitalization, including a new police/fire station. Plans also call for a 13-story hotel and two nine-story office buildings. The city had even worked out a verbal agreement with the county to buy the old jail, Dunagan said. The plan called for the city to then lease the facility back to the county so it could sub-lease it to CCA, he said. But that deal would have run for eight years, Dunagan said, then the city would have the option of shutting it down. Councilman George Wangemann said the city is behind the economic boost the prison could bring to the city, but he wants it to fit in with the aesthetics. Louise Grant, CCA marketing and communications director, said that while the company is in the business of operating prisons, it is working to resolve the aesthetics issue with the city. “Safety and security is our first and foremost priority,” she said. “We’re making a $4 million investment to upgrade the facility.” Grant said razor wire is common at all its 60 facilities, but alternative fencing is being discussed. Since last week’s announcement of the prison opening, CCA has received some 500 applications for the approximately 120 jobs available, Grant said.

    "sentence": "PSC official may face $24,000 in ethics fines. Georgia’s newest utility regulator could face more than $20,000 in fines for state ethics violations stemming from a 2002 campaign. State Public Service Commissioner Lauren McDonald didn’t quibble with the facts behind the ethics commission allegations, which were heard by an administratitve law judge Monday. But McDonald said he’d corrected his campaign disclosures years ago, according to a transcript of his Monday remarks. He asked that the case be dismissed because of its age, and that his fine be $5,000. McDonald’s violations happened during his 2002 PSC campaign. He lost to former commissioner Angela Speir, then won the seat back last fall. The ethics commission said McDonald filed one report late and filed others with missing information. He failed to properly record 80 individual contributions totaling $46,000 and 14 expenditures totaling $76,000, for instance. McDonald amended his filings to include the missing information after a complaint filed in 2004. He believed, he said, that “I was given a clean bill of health” then and was “surprised to say the least” last fall after learning the state was pursuing the issue. State ethics law changed in 2005. It allows fines of up to $1,000 per violation, which the commission defines as each piece of bad information in a disclosure. An ethics commission witness said McDonald’s fines could hit $24,000, based on an internal formula that weighs the seriousness of each violation.",

    "sentence": "More rain on the way Tuesday night. A day after the state’s climatologist declared the drought officially over in most of north Georgia, the first of two more rain-making weather systems pushed toward metro Atlanta early Tuesday. The National Weather Service said a frontal system will likely produce an inch of rain across north Georgia late Tuesday into Wednesday, with as much as 3 to 4 inches of rain possible across central and southern parts of the state. The rain should taper off Wednesday night, with another cold front arriving late Thursday, forecasters said. That system “also seems to be a good precipitiation producer, with another 1 to 2 inches expected,” the Weather Service said. On Monday, state climatologist David Stooksbury said that an usually wet March “has brought major drought relief to North Georgia. Except for the Lake Lanier and Lake Hartwell basins, “the remainder of north Georgia is drought-free,” Stooksbury said. The Weather Service has recorded 7.12 inches of rain so far this month at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, a surplus of 1.89 inches. For the year, the city’s official rain gauge has tallied 13.70 inches of rain, only 1.24 inches below normal. The forecast for metro Atlanta calls for mostly cloudy skies, with a 40 percent chance of showers and highs in the low 60s Tuesday afternoon. The chance of rain jumps to 100 percent overnight, before falling back to 30 percent on Wednesday. Lows Tuesday night will be in the low 50s, followed by highs Wednesday in the upper 60s. Thursday will begin mostly sunny, with a 40 percent chance of shower and thunderstorms during the afternoon, when highs will be in the mid-70s, the Weather Service said. A 90 percent chance of rain is predicted for Thursday night, along with lows around 50 degrees. Partly sunny skies, highs in the upper 60s and a 20 percent chance of showers are forecast for Friday. The first part of the weekend should be nice, with mostly sunny skies and temperatures in the mid-70s on Saturday, followed by a 40 percent chance of rain on Sunday.",

    "sentence": "Statewide 211 could reach more poor. Regional 2-1-1, a dialing code linking needy Georgia residents with everything from food pantries to social services, could begin expanding statewide by the end of the year, United Way officials said. If approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission, the expansion would stretch the service to 69 currently unserved counties. Those include several rural counties, among the hardest-hit by foreclosure and unemployment in the state. “You want folks to be able to have access to information that helps them address basic needs — and you want them to be able to access that information wherever they live in the state,” said Milton J. Little Jr., president of United Way of Metropolitan Atlanta, which initiated the exchange in 1997 and is leading efforts to expand statewide. United Way officials hope to submit a proposal to the commission by the end of the year. Right now, 2-1-1 callers are connected with operators at one of 11 call centers serving metropolitan regions across the state. Callers explain their needs to operators — anything from shelter after a weather catastrophe to rental assistance — who refer them to area service agencies. Organizers say the idea is to help people navigate the complex and ever-growing network of programs. It helps the needy in the most heavily populated areas of Georgia. But United Way officials have lacked the funds to expand to farther-flung areas, Little said. For them, “resources as critical as emergency financial help to as general as where do I find a place to send my aging parents — they just don’t have access,” Little said. Expansion plans coincide with an increase in calls to the line. Operators fielded more than 370,000 calls in 2008, up from more than 336,000 in 2007. Little said some calls this time last year were for post-tornado help in the region. “A lot of those callers now are bringing up issues related to food, clothing and shelter,” said Little, who recently estimated 41.5 percent of Atlanta-area calls are for help with day-to-day expenses. Other states have been pushing to expand the program which United Way estimates connects 234 million people with social services. There are 29 states with full coverage, according to Linda Daily, director for 2-1-1 at United Way of America. They include Texas, where state funds cover 80 percent of the program’s budget, she said. But many states are grappling with heavy shortfalls, and Daily acknowledged funding 2-1-1 could be a challenge. “The budget is the main hurdle,” she said, adding national United Way officials have lobbied Congress for help nationalizing the 2-1-1 program. Pending federal legislation could set aside $150 million in state 2-1-1 grant money for fiscal years 2010 and 2011, and $100 million for each of fiscal years 2012 through 2015. Versions of the bill are in committee in both the House and Senate. In Georgia, a coalition of United Way agencies led by the Atlanta agency will draft a plan that outlines how to fund the expansion, including possible use of state money. It will have to be approved by the commission and later, state lawmakers.",

    "sentence": "Opposition Activists Held on Arms Charges. Ten persons, most of them affiliated with former parliamentary speaker Nino Burjanadze’s party, have been arrested on charges of illegal purchase of firearms, the Georgian Interior Ministry said on March 23. Earlier on the same day Democratic Movement–United Georgia (DMUG) party said nine of its activists were arrested in Batumi and Tbilisi, accusing the authorities of launching “campaign of terror” against its activists. The Interior Ministry said it was not claiming “a political conspiracy” behind the arms purchase. “The Interior Ministry, along with other preventive measures, is constantly monitoring illegal turnover of arms,” the Interior Ministry said in a statement. “Recently several groups have been identified, which were showing interest in purchasing automatic firearms. Several members of these groups were arrested this morning. The Interior Ministry was not planning to make any statement until the end of the investigation, but some political and public organizations have responded to the incident and the issue was seriously politicized. The representatives of some political parties made tough statements. Hence, the Interior Ministry is providing to the society a part of evidence proving criminal activities of the detainees. Other evidences and information will be unveiled later.” The evidence involves six separate episodes of covertly recorded footage of what seems to be a sting operation by undercover agents acting as arms dealers. In the fist footage a man identified as Giorgi Bolashvili, an activist from DMUG youth wing, negotiates with undercover agent terms for purchase of CZ-75 semi-automatic pistol for USD 400 and expresses desire to buy AKS-U submachine gun – a shortened version of Kalashnikov assault rifle. In the second footage a man identified as Bolashvili’s cousin with the same first and second name – Giorgi Bolashvili meets the same undercover agent to buy the firearm. In the third episode a man identified as Vakhtang Narsia, an activist from DMUG youth wing, holding apparently UZI submachine gun, is discussing with another man – supposedly also an undercover agent – mobilization of supporters. In the fourth footage, Mamuka Shengelia, a driver of Badri Bitsadze, husband of Nino Burjanadze, is seen discussing specifications and price of various firearms with a person – apparently also an undercover agent. In the fifth and sixth footage a person identified as Giorgi Tsertsvadze is seen – his name was not listed among the DMUG’s arrested activists released earlier by the party itself. Tsertsvadze, according to the Interior Ministry, was acting under the instructions of Shengelia to purchase the firearms. The sixth footage, also recorded covertly in what seems to be an apartment room, Tsertsvadze is checking various types of firearms massed in a corner of the room. Shota Utiashvili, head of the Interior Ministry’s analytical department, has strongly denied any politics behind the arrest of these persons and also said that the investigation was not claiming there was “a political conspiracy.” “What we know is that there are people who have showed interest in buying weapons and have bought weapons and they are arrested,” Utiashvili said. Nino Burjanadze, the leader of DMUG, said after the Interior Ministry’s statement that she was ready to cooperate with the investigation. She, however, said the evidence put forth by the investigation was not enough and needed further scrutiny. “Not a single normal court will consider the evidences shown on TV as enough evidence to prove the charges that have been made,” she told journalists. “We are familiar with such ‘video evidence’ and how they are made up. The footage needs very serious expertise. Probably the Interior Ministry will make this expertise. We will also try to make this expertise through our independent sources: when the footage was recorded, in what context, when and how the footage was edited and so on.” “We are not rejecting to cooperate with the investigation,” Burjanadze said and also added that the footage provided by the Interior Ministry would fail to confirm the allegations that her party was planning “armed rebellion and was setting up armed groups for this purpose.” Earlier this month the Georgian tabloid Alia reported that Bitsadze had a plan to set up armed groups. In an unusual move, the Rustavi 2 TV, picked up the newspaper article and covered the allegations extensively in its primetime news program on March 10. Meanwhile, it also emerged on March 23, that an activist from the Movement for Salvation of Georgia was arrested and charged with plotting a coup. The Movement for Salvation of Georgia was set up late last year and has not been an active player in the Georgian politics. Shota Utiashvili of the Interior Ministry told Civil. Ge that this arrest was not related with the case of illegal arms purchase. He said the Interior Ministry would unveil more details on the matter later. Some opposition politicians have expressed doubts about the credibility of the evidence put forth by the Interior Ministry. Zviad Dzidziguri of the Conservative Party, which along with DMUG and some other parties is planning to launch protest rallies from April 9 to demand President Saakashvili’s resignation, said: “It was entirely a political stage show in which some fooled persons are taking part.” Eka Beselia from Movement for United Georgia Party – also from the same group of parties planning April rallies, said: “There is no confidence towards such evidence put forth by the Interior Ministry.” A group of opposition parties signed a joint statement condemning the arrest.",

    "sentence": "Ten Sent to Pre-Trial Custody. The Tbilisi City Court ruled on March 25 to send ten men, most of them with arms charges and others on coup plotting, to a two-month pretrial custody pending investigation. The eighth person, Giorgi Tsertsvadze, although not listed among DMUG’s party activists arrested on March 23, was also held on the same charges of illegal arms purchase and according to the investigation was acting under the instructions of Mamuka Shengelia. Initial list of arrested persons disseminated by DMUG through the Public Defender’s Office on March 23, hours after their arrest, also includes two activists - Nugzar Gogrichidze and Vakhtang Tushmalashvili. However, no word has been said by the investigation so far about these two persons. Although these two groups of suspects are formally being investigated in separate cases, both of these cases are politically considered in the same context of planned April 9 protest rally, as according to the investigation, some of the suspects were discussing possibility of provoking disorders during the planned rally. At the same time the Interior Ministry said it was not claiming political conspiracy behind these cases or that any high-profile opposition leader was behind the alleged plot. The Interior Ministry, however, also says that the investigation is yet “on its very early stage.” Meanwhile, some opposition politicians say that evidence put forth by the investigation are not convincing and suggest that the series of arrests aim at scaring off the public from the planned protest rallies with revoking possible scenarios similar to the one that developed in Georgia in early 1990s, when armed coup was followed by years of chaos. Ten are from two separate groups with one having links to the Burjanadze’s party.",

    "sentence": "Okruashvili: Saakashvili Greater Threat than Russia. Irakli Okruashvili, former defense minister, said Georgia was in a situation wherein removal of President Saakashvili from power “is justified with any humanely method,” as he posed “greater threat” to the country than Russia. Okruashvili, whose party Movement for United Georgia is part of group of another dozen of opposition parties planning to launch street protest rallies from April 9 to demand the President’s resignation, said in a televised interview that he personally had no presidential ambitions. The interview, which was recorded in Paris on March 24, was aired by late on March 27 by the Tbilisi-based Maestro TV, which covers mainly the capital city. Okruashvili, who has received political asylum in France, was sentenced to 11-year prison term in Georgia in absentia last year. “After [the August] war politicians should give up manipulating with the issue of restoration of the territorial integrity, especially during the election campaign, because that is an issue, which will be impossible to resolve in next ten or fifteen years in the best case, if not in the next twenty or twenty five years,” he said. Okruashvili said that after the August “military adventure” Saakashvili had “no legitimate right to stay in power.” “I know that the remarks, which I will say now will trigger lots of sharp comments, but I have to say it anyway – this is the case when removal of Saakashvili from power is justifiable with any humanely method. He is today the number one threat for the country and the greater threat than Russia,” Okruashvili said. He said he did not believe that Russia was interested in removal of Georgia’s current leadership and said such rhetoric was part of the authorities’ “propaganda.” “A weak figure [in the Georgian leadership] like Saakashvili is more acceptable for Russia,” Okruashvili said. “Saakashvili, who has almost no western support and no one in the west is even saying hello to him, is more acceptable for Russia. New leader in Georgia means new hope… One thing is clear: Saakashvili is a headache for both the Georgian people and for the international community.” “If in 2003 [the Rose Revolution] was called the democratic revolution, than today too the same right exists to repeat it; is there enough resources or not for that purpose, that’s another issue,” he continued. “It is up to the Georgian people, it is our duty to maximally painlessly remove Saakashvili from power. How that will be achieved? No one has the answer on that today… A right vision, a joint action plan on where we are moving is required here, instead of changing plans every day. If there is a clear vision and joint plan [by the opposition] it will be achieved.” “Removal of Saakashvili will be a painful process and it won’t be able to achieve in a day; it won’t happen on April 9,” he said. Okruashvili said that unity of the opposition was the only “medicine that will help to removal Saakashvili.” “We [the opposition leaders] should forget all the personal regrets and mutual confrontation that we might had in the past,” he said and added his party’s relation with the one of former parliamentary chairperson Nino Burjanadze’s was a good example of that. He said that in 2007 when he was arrested, Burjanadze, who was the parliamentary chairperson at that time welcomed his arrested and “made a speech in the Parliament which amounted to accusing me in the state treason; but today I have no problem in relations with Burjanadze, because we will fail to achieve our joint goal without forgetting personal regrets of the past.”",

Support police car, assisting the wounded police crew, was blown up by a second mine about 15 minutes after the first explosion. EU Monitoring Mission in Georgia (EUMM) said the first explosion seemed to be triggered by a trip-wire.

    "sentence": "South Ossetia on edge of war. Diplomats are pushing urgent peace talks between Georgian and South Ossetian officials to avert all-out war as heavy fighting in the region killed at least a dozen yesterday. Tensions have only escalated in breakaway South Ossetia after severe violence last weekend, and show no sign of abating. The streets of the secessionist capital are reportedly abandoned and Tbilisi says the South Ossetian separatist leader has fled. In an address to the nation yesterday evening, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili said he ordered a unilateral ceasefire. “A few hours ago I gave an ordera very painful order for a commander-in-chief to givethat not a single Georgian unit, neither a police nor other unit under our control should return fire to end the very intense bombardment.” “We must stop this spiral of violence.” Interfax reported that Russian officials have succeeded in arranging emergency talks between Georgian and separatist officials for tomorrow. Talks scheduled for yesterday were derailed, ostensibly over a disagreement on what format the negotiations would be in. As of last night the violence was continuing, and Georgian officials denied reports that the South Ossetians had agreed to a ceasefire. Violence grew throughout week The confrontation sparked last weekend after the fiercest fighting in years left six dead. The conflict zone fell briefly quiet after that, but growing clashes have pushed the situation to the edge over the last several days. Both sides reported heavy shootouts overnight Wednesday that continued into the day. By yesterday evening, the South Ossetians counted two dead and 18 wounded. Reports put the number of Georgian dead at ten, with 50 wounded. Tbilisi says the separatists launched an attack yesterday on the Georgian-controlled villages of Nuli and Avnevi in a bid to take strategic heights overlooking the area. A Georgian armored personnel carrier was destroyed in the attacks, confirmed Interior Ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili, wounding three Georgian troops. “Heavy shootings continue,” he told the Messenger yesterday. The South Ossetian separatist press committee said Georgian forces attacked an Ossetian-controlled village and were pushed back from strategic hills. Late in the evening Utiashvili said that South Ossetian fighters continued to attack despite the Georgian ceasefire. The Georgian-controlled village of Prisi reportedly came under attack late last night. Separatists had claimed the day before there were Georgian artillery attacks from the heights above Prisi. Tamarasheni, a Georgian town a stone’s throw from Tskhinvali, also came under fire last night, according to the Georgian Interior Ministry. Accusations of preparing for war Tbilisi accuses the separatists of starting the violence. A Georgian Foreign Ministry statement yesterday said the separatists’ attacks are made “with the purpose of inciting large-scale confrontation and thwarting direct dialogue.” An earlier statement pointed to South Ossetian announcements of arriving volunteer fighters from the North Caucasus as further evidence they are gearing up for war. Separatist officials accuse Georgia of amassing armored vehicles and infantry near the edge of the conflict zone, and say they have evacuated women and children from Tskhinvali. They also claim Grad missile systems are set up by the Georgian town of Gori, south of the conflict zone. Eyewitnesses in the area said they saw large Georgian military convoys headed toward for the region. Utiashvili, the Interior Ministry spokesman, denied the deployment of missile systems but confirmed a “rotation of military forces near Gori.” A Russian peacekeeper officer in South Ossetia told reporters yesterday that their forces recorded eight flyovers of Georgian warplanes and surveillance drones in the previous 24 hours. Yesterday’s Georgian Foreign Ministry statement said Moscow shoulders much of the blame for the violence. “The only way that separatists manage to maintain their grip on power is through military, human and technical resources provided to them by the Russian Federation,” the statement read. “The recent developments have shown clearly that the position of the Russian Federation will be the decisive factor in how the process will unfold in the Tskhinvali region.” Russia’s deputy foreign minister said the remarks were “unfair” and that Moscow is trying to mediate in the crisis to prevent more bloodshed. The Georgian president’s speech, delivered after the Foreign Ministry statement was released, changed the tone on Russia’s responsibility for the clashes: “The leaders of the [Russian] peacekeeping force told us a few hours ago they have completely lost control over the separatists’ actions We are in constant contact with the Russian Foreign Ministry’s leadership. The Russian Foreign Ministry is tryingthey say they are trying, but not succeedingto get the separatists to cease fire.” Georgia is Russia’s “natural ally,” said Saakashvili. Tbilisi urges talks after negotiations fail Georgia’s top official for conflict issues, Temur Iakobashvili, told reporters that hoped-for talks fell through after he traveled to the conflict zone yesterday, where South Ossetian representatives refused to meet him. “Tskhinvali looked empty, as I know [separatist leader Eduard] Kokoity has left the town,” Iakobashvili said, adding that Russia’s own envoy was not able to reach Tskhinvali due to car troubles. Asked whether Georgian army troops could be sent into South Ossetia, Iakobashvili said: “We are doing everything to resolve the tense situation by peaceful means. However, we’re always ready to protect our citizens wherever they are.” Earlier in the week Tbilisi announced that direct talks were scheduled, but South Ossetian officials later said they would not participate, insisting that any negotiations must be within the Joint Control Commission format which includes Russian, North Ossetian, South Ossetian and Georgian representatives. Georgia says the Joint Control Commission is unbalanced and declared last year it would no longer take part in its meetings. Saakashvili last night called for direct talks in “any kind of format.” He also reiterated offers of wide autonomy for South Ossetia within Georgia, which he said Russia could oversee. Deep international concern The OSCE, EU and UN all weighed in yesterday with statements of concern over the violence, calling for an immediate halt and direct negotiations. Reuters reported that senior US State Department official Daniel Fried and the deputy Russian foreign minister had spoken and agreed to cooperate on keeping the violence from growing.",

    "sentence": "Border guards search for missing Latvian climbers. Border Police are searching for three Latvian mountain climbers missing for days in the mountains of Svaneti. The Latvians, aged 25, 29 and 40, are three of a fifteen-person tourist group traveling around Svaneti. The trio broke off from the group to explore the mountain of Ushba and have not been heard from since August 4. The remaining members reported the missing climbers to a Border Police checkpoint, which immediately sent out a small search group. They began searching August 5; the next day, another twenty border guards joined the search. According to a Georgian Border Police spokesperson, a one-kilometer-wide sheet of snow fell into the valley near Ushba, a 4 700-meter-tall peak known to be one of the most treacherous and inaccessible mountains in the western part of the Caucasus mountains. “Personal belongingsa camera and backpacks of the missing people were found in the snow. It is likely that the tourists got buried under the same avalanche,” a spokesperson said. In 2004, two well-known Georgian climbers died on Ushba while attempting an ascent via the Mishlyaev route, considered the most challenging path to the summit. Zurab Kuchava, a prominent Georgian mountaineer, explains that there is no established search and rescue organization in the region. “There are scattered groups, but actually there is no rescue servicewe do it on a case-by-case basis, with individual forces. A centralized rescue team needs lots of money, and this is probably not in the interest of the people who are in charge [of the country],” he said in an earlier interview. The Border Police were tasked with the ad hoc rescue operation because the Latvians came to them to report the missing group. Border Police representatives say they hold out hope the missing climbers will be found alive.",

Shulman died in 2003, and Robertson bought out her siblings to continue running the Webster. Tragedy struck the Webster last year, when booker Ben Wu disappeared while on the island of Tortola to attend the wedding of Robertson's daughter, Stephanie Decker. Wu is presumed to have drowned. Robertson, who had in the past fielded inquiries about selling the theater, said the incident helped her decide to sell if she got the right offer. Peters made the right offer. \"He is the right person for the Webster and the right person for Hartford,\" Robertson said.",

    "sentence": "County lifts burn ban. The burn ban issued for Walker County on Jan. 18 was lifted Monday following a conference between Huntsville Fire Chief Tom Grisham and Walker County Judge Danny Pierce. With the discontinuation of the burn ban, all Walker County residents will now be allowed to conduct outdoor burns. Those residents living within Huntsville city limits, however, will be required to obtain an updated burning permit from the fire department. “Grisham and Pierce met today and lifted the burn ban on county, so anybody in the county is allowed to burn,” said Jason January with the Huntsville Fire Department. “On the 14-day outlook, it shows us being out of immediate fire danger, and while different parts of the county have received different amounts of rain, we’ve dropped an average of two hazard classes as an entire county.” Residents of Huntsville will be able to pick up a burning permit — which is mandatory for city residents who plan to burn — at either of the city’s fire stations, January said. “While the burn ban has been lifted, people who live in the city will still need to come by Huntsville Fire Station 1 or 2 to obtain a new burning permit,” he said. “This is necessary because all burning permits expire once a burn ban has been enacted.” January said the burning permits, which are free to the public, will allow the permit holders to burn for 60 days. While the permits will negate any legal concerns for residents, January said the community is still encouraged to keep in contact with the local fire department to stay aware of any future burn bans. “Even though we received some rain over the last week, we can’t predict conditions for the area in the next few weeks,” he said. “Based on how much rain we receive in the next few weeks, the burn ban could go back into effect.” According to January, 190 of approximately 250 counties in the state are still under burn bans, but the change in soil saturation seen in Walker County has allowed the local ban to be lifted. “Though we have lifted our burn ban for the time being, we still want to make sure everybody is being really careful,” he said. “We’re thankful we’re able to do this now, primarily because it allows us to clear out a lot of debris, trash and wood that has piled up since January. “Still, we want people to exercise caution as we’re probably going to have some controlled burns get out of control, even with this amount of rain.” Walker County residents are also asked to be considerate of their neighbors while burning, as certain items to be burned may produce high amounts of smoke. “We have a definite concern with the amount of wetness in things that might be burned,” January said. “Things like sticks, brush and leaves are all wet right now, and when people try to light those things on fire, they’re going to create a lot of smoke. “We just want everyone to think about their neighbors whenever they’re burning.”",

    "sentence": "House passes bill taxing bonuses for AIG, others. WASHINGTON — Denouncing a “squandering of the people’s money,” lawmakers voted decisively Thursday to impose a 90 percent tax on millions of dollars in employee bonuses paid by troubled insurance giant AIG and other bailed-out companies. The House vote was 328-93. Similar legislation has been introduced in the Senate and President Barack Obama quickly signaled general support for the concept. “I look forward to receiving a final product that will serve as a strong signal to the executives who run these firms that such compensation will not be tolerated,” the president said in a statement. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, told colleagues, “We want our money back now for the taxpayers. It isn’t that complicated.” The outcome may not have been complicated. But the lopsided vote failed to reflect the contentious political battle that preceded it. Republicans took Democrats to task for rushing to tax AIG bonuses worth an estimated $165 million after the majority party stripped from last month’s economic stimulus bill a provision that could have banned such payouts. “This political circus that’s going on here today with this bill is not getting to the bottom of the questions of who knew what and when did they know it,” said House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio. He voted “no,” but 85 fellow Republicans joined 243 Democrats in voting “yes.” It was opposed by six Democrats and 87 Republicans. The bill would impose a 90 percent tax on bonuses given to employees with family incomes above $250,000 at American International Group and other companies that have received at least $5 billion in government bailout money. It would apply to any such bonuses issued since Dec. 31. The House vote, after just 40 minutes of debate, showed how quickly Congress can act when the political will is there. It was only this past weekend that the bailed-out insurance giant paid bonuses totaling $165 million to employees, including traders in the Financial Products unit that nearly brought about AIG’s collapse. AIG has received $182.5 billion in federal bailout money and is now 80 percent government owned. Disclosure of the bonuses touched off a national firestorm that both the Obama administration and Congress have scurried to contain. In a statement issued by the White House late Thursday, Obama said the House vote “rightly reflects the outrage that so many feel over the lavish bonuses that AIG provided its employees at the expense of the taxpayers who have kept this failed company afloat. ”“In the end, this is a symptom of a larger problem — a bubble-and-bust economy that valued reckless speculation over responsibility and hard work,” he said. “That is what we must ultimately repair to build a lasting and widespread prosperity.” Topic No. 1 raised by Republicans during the House debate was the last-minute altering of a provision in Obama’s $787 billion stimulus law to cap executive compensation for firms receiving government bailouts. The measure might have forestalled payment of the AIG bonuses. But Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat and the author of the provision, says the administration insisted that he modify his proposal so that it would only apply to payments agreed to in the future. That, critics claim, cleared the way for the AIG payouts. “The idea came from the administration,” Dodd said ThursdayDodd said he was not aware of any AIG bonuses at the time the change was made. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner confirmed such conversations with Dodd. He said the administration was worried about possible legal challenges to the provision. “We expressed concern about this specific version,” Geithner said in an interview with CNN. “But we also worked with him to strengthen the overall bill.” The treasury secretary, who has been criticized for not learning of the AIG bonus payments sooner since he helped orchestrate the bailout last year as president of the New York Fed, said anew in the interview that he was not informed of the bonuses until last week. “And as soon as I heard about the full scale of these things, we moved very actively to explore every possible legal avenue to address this problem,” Geithner said. A similar — but not as punitive — bill to recoup bonus payments with taxes was gaining support in the Senate. It would impose a 35 percent excise tax on the companies paying the bonuses and a 35 percent tax on the employees receiving them. The taxes would apply to all companies receiving government bailout money, but they are clearly geared toward AIG. “This is not just another case of runaway corporate greed and arrogance, ripping off shareholders by excesses lavished around the executive suite,” said Rep. Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D. “These bonuses represent a squandering of the people’s money. ... Starting right here, right now, we are saying no more.” The Senate measure is sponsored by Sen. Max Baucus of Montana, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and the panel’s senior Republican, Chuck Grassley of Iowa. It was expected to be brought to the Senate floor next week. Meanwhile, New York’s attorney general, Andrew Cuomo, said AIG has given him the list of employees who received a total of $165 million in retention bonuses. Cuomo said he won’t release any employees’ names until his office has answered any security concerns raised by the AIG employees. He also said he will work with AIG in the coming days to determine which workers have decided to return the payments. Cuomo had sought the names from AIG chief executive Edward Liddy through a subpoena. The deadline was Thursday. About 400 AIG employees and future employees received bonuses, but not all of them earned over the $250,000 family income threshold specified by the House bill. Obama administration special envoy Richard Holbooke was on AIG’s board of directors in early 2008, when the insurance company committed to the bonuses, and during the previous years of aggressive investment strategies that brought the firm to brink of collapse. White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said Thursday: “Mr. Holbrooke had nothing to do with and knew nothing about the bonuses.” While the House legislation calls for a 90 percent tax, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said he expected local and state governments to take the remaining 10 percent of the bonuses. Rangel said the bill would apply to mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, among others, while excluding community banks and other smaller companies that have received less bailout money. “The American people demand protection and that’s what we’re doing today,” he told the House.",

    "sentence": "Past year has been ‘best’ for Dyer. The 2008 Walker County Fair Queen made one of her last official appearances Tuesday during the annual Committeeman’s Barbecue at the Walker County Fairgrounds. Jordan Dyer, a 17-year-old Huntsville High School student, has spent the last year making more than 30 public appearances in Huntsville and in counties around the state as the current fair queen. Now, just days before the 2009 Walker County Fair Queen is to be crowned, Dyer is all smiles as she fulfills her final duties. “This was probably the best year I’ve ever had,” Dyer said. “I probably went to about 30 or 40 events throughout the year, including all kinds of fair functions, shows and meetings. “It was a really busy year, but I knew going into it that I was going to have that much to do, and I had a great time.” Dyer’s favorite part of being the fair queen was working with younger participants on events like the Prince and Princess Contest. “I learned a lot both while traveling around the state and while working with different groups in Walker County,” Dyer said. “Not only did I make friendships that will last a lifetime, but I gained leadership and communication skills as well. “I didn’t realize how many kids would be looking up to me in this position, and I definitely had to stay on my best behavior for the entire year.” With a new fair queen to be crowned Saturday, Dyer has very few remaining duties to fulfill as the current queen. “In addition to participating in the Committeeman’s Barbecue, I’m also going to be involved in the annual Walker County Fair Association Parade, and I’ll also be part of the rehearsals for the opening ceremonies,” she said. “Of course, I’ll be available to help the girls in this year’s queen contest get ready for their events, as well. “I know the girls who are competing — especially those who end up in the queen’s court and the new queen herself — are going to have a great time. The whole experience was a lot of fun, and I would definitely do it again if I could.” While Dyer was showing her contest heifer in Houston on the day of the 2009 queen participants’ contest presentations, she said she was very impressed with the video recording of the contest. “I think everybody did a really great job with their projects, and I think every one of the contestants has a really good shot at earning the crown,” she said. “Whoever doesn’t win, I hope they continue on and participate in the contest next year. “Regardless of who wins the contest, I would just want to tell that person not to take the experience for granted. I think they should just have fun with it, be really respectful to the other contestants and not be stressed out.” On July 30, Dyer will turn 18, and while she previously planned to attend Stephen F. Austin University, she has considered changing her plans and applying to Sam Houston State University. Wherever she attends college, Dyer says she wants to major in nursing and participate in National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association events.",

    "sentence": "More bad wiring imperils troops in Iraq. WASHINGTON — The military is racing to inspect more than 90,000 U.S.-run facilities across Iraq to reduce a deadly threat troops face far off the battlefield: electrocution or shock while showering or using appliances. About one-third of the inspections so far have turned up major electrical problems, according to interviews and an internal military document obtained by The Associated Press. Half of the problems they found have since been fixed but about 65,000 facilities still need to be inspected, which could take the rest of this year. Senior Pentagon officials were on Capitol Hill this week for briefings on the findings. The work assigned to Task Force SAFE, which oversees the inspections and repairs, is aimed at preventing deaths like that of Staff Sgt. Ryan Maseth, 24, of Pittsburgh. He died in January 2008, one of at least three soldiers killed while showering since the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Scores more soldiers suffered shocks between September 2006 and July 2008, according to a database maintained by KBR Inc., the Houston-based contractor that oversees maintenance at most U.S. facilities in Iraq. “We got a ton of buildings we know probably aren’t safe and we just don’t have them done yet,” said Jim Childs, an electrician the task force hired to help with the inspections. “It’s Russian roulette. I cringe every time I hear of a shock.” Ron Vance, who served as a sergeant in the California Army National Guard, remembers being knocked out cold in a shower building in 2004 in Taji, Iraq. He said he screamed and fell while showering, suffering burns on his back and shoulders. Another soldier who tried to pry him from the shower head also was injured. Vance, 57, of Fresno, Calif., said he’s still too traumatized to shower without his wife nearby. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa. , called Task Force SAFE’s findings troubling. He said the task force is doing good work but said problems should have been fixed much earlier. “Just imagine getting the news that they’ve done 25,000 facilities, but your son or daughter is in the 65,000 they haven’t done,” Casey told the AP. Last year, 94 troops stationed in Iraq, Afghanistan or other Central Command countries sought medical treatment for electric shock, according to Defense Department health data. KBR’s database lists 231 electric shock incidents in the more than 89,000 facilities the company runs in Iraq, according to military records. KBR is the target of a wrongful death lawsuit filed by Maseth’s family. They claim the company knew there were electrical problems in the building where he died, but didn’t fix them. His mother testified last year on Capitol Hill. Army investigators have since reclassified Maseth’s death as negligent homicide caused by KBR and two of its supervisors. An Army investigator said KBR failed to ensure work was done by qualified electricians and plumbers. The case is under legal review. “KBR is not responsible for the electrocution deaths widely reported, including that of Staff Sgt. Ryan Maseth,” Heather Browne, a KBR spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. KBR and another contractor, Arkel International, are the targets of a second lawsuit, filed by the family of another soldier electrocuted in Iraq, Staff Sgt. Christopher Lee Everett, 23, of Huntsville, Texas. Everett, a member of the Texas Army National Guard, was killed in September 2005 when the power washer he was using to clean a vehicle short-circuited. Task Force SAFE inspectors found many of the facilities that fall under KBR’s contract have electrical problems, according to an internal military document obtained by The Associated Press. Of the 20,340 maintained by KBR and inspected so far, 6,935 failed the government inspection, the document said. When about 2,000 of the buildings with faulty work were re-inspected, the facilities passed, the document said. The Defense Contract Management Agency has accepted KBR’s plans to correct the problems, according to the document the AP obtained. It said the agency will closely oversee KBR’s work. Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., questioned why KBR has been allowed to continue to perform electrical work in Iraq. He said the military should take a more careful look at the electrical work in Afghanistan, too, where KBR also has a large contract for electrical work. “If they found widespread problems, the obvious question is why has there not been action to remove the contract and bring in another contractor?” Dorgan said. Browne, the company spokeswoman, said KBR has cooperated with the government, performing technical inspection and providing requested information. Task Force SAFE (the acronym stands for Safety Action for Fire and Electricity) said it is making progress. The Army is tracking reports of just over two fires each day in Iraq, mostly blamed on electrical faults. But that’s down from nearly five fires a day, Brig. Gen. Kurt Stein said in an e-mail to the AP. Stein said the number of electrical shocks has also been reduced. “Although we are still seeing some electrical shocks, they tend to be minor and are often preventable,” Stein said. In addition to the repairs, Stein said the military has purchased more reliable surge protectors to replace ones that had been bought in Iraq. “Our hearts go out to the families of those who died or were injured from electrical shock or fire,” Stein said. “We take our job to inspect, identify, repair and prevent electrical and fire incidents very seriously.” Vance, the guardsman who was shocked in the shower, said the military didn’t take his injuries seriously. He’s since retired on partial disability from the Veterans Affairs Department for a “cognitive disorder” related to the incident, but he has sought additional compensation for what he describes as ongoing knee and shoulder problems for falling in the shower. “I really don’t think they cared. I didn’t die,” Vance said. “It wasn’t a priority on their list. It was like, he’s fine. He’s alive. He’s OK.”",

    "sentence": "Deadline set to register for AP testing. Huntsville High School students have until Tuesday to register for 2009 advanced placement testing, and the student body is encouraged to take advantage of the testing opportunity. The advanced placement exams will allow students to earn potential college credits, whether they are enrolled in advanced placement courses or not. According to Nikki Surley, HHS counselor, students will be expected to pay $56 per test, and the full payment amount must be submitted by Tuesday to avoid incurring late registration costs. “The annual CollegeBoard AP tests will be administered from May 4-8 and May 11-15, and the deadline for students to register for these exams is this Tuesday,” Surley said. “Tests will cost students $56 each, and the only students who will pay less for those tests are those who are on free and reduced lunch. “If they do not register for the tests and pay the full $56 registration fee, they may register late until April 15. However, the students will have to pay an additional $40 per test if they register after Tuesday.” Surley said the exam schedule is the same for every high school in the country, and the days students take their specific tests depend on that schedule. “Students cannot change the days they take tests on, but most of the time, they don’t overlap on tests,” she said. “We just really want to encourage students to take these tests, because they’re basically earning college credit at a largely reduced rate. “Students should also know they are eligible to take any AP exam they choose, even if they are not enrolled in the subject of the exam this semester.” AP exams are scored on a five-point scale with a score of five being the highest. Surley said different universities require different scores on the exams for students to earn credit equivalents with the exams. “Kids who want to use these tests for college credits need to check with their universities to verify their score requirements,” she said. “Some universities don’t even accept AP credits, and it’s very important to know that ahead of time. “Even if students cannot use the tests or do not perform well enough on them to earn college credits, the experience of taking the exams is still valuable.” Students who wish to register for AP exams must speak with Shelly Christie in the HHS main office. Payment may be made with cash or a check, and all checks must include the student’s driver’s license number.

    "sentence": "City manager seeks support for road work. Huntsville City Manager Bill Baine is currently working to gather support — both at the city level and at the county level — for an improvement project on state Highway 19. At a recent Walker County Commissioners Court meeting, the five-member court agreed to assist Baine in receiving a $2 million engineering grant with a $400,000 matching requirement. Now, Baine must take the grant before City Council, and he said he is very hopeful that the council will also be supportive of the project. “The grant we’re looking at is a $2 million federal grant for economic development and hurricane mitigation,” Baine said. “Our justification for applying for the grant is that we want to improve Highway 19 so it can take some traffic off of Interstate 45 and around the city, especially during hurricane evacuations. “Receiving this $2 million, which would be used to design of an improved 6.2-mile portion of Highway 19, would get us in line for future funding for the construction costs.” According to Glenn Isbell, city engineer for the City of Huntsville, the portion of Highway 19 that would be addressed in the plan rests with Huntsville city limits and includes several major intersections. “Basically, we’re looking at creating an urban arterial on a portion of Highway 19 between Interstate 45 and Highway 30 that is largely undeveloped,” he said. “That would involve creating a five-lane, curb and gutter section with a raised center median which would allow for left-turn movements. “We would also want to construct on- and off-ramps at the intersections of Highway 19 and state Highway 75, Bearkat Boulevard and Highway 190. With the right ramp configuration, the ramp at Bearkat Boulevard would become a major entrance into Sam Houston State University. “As well, we would also look at some possible traffic signals to control cross-over traffic, and we would also consider reducing the speed limit from 60 miles per hour to 50 in that portion of Highway 19.” Including the $2 million engineering grant, Isbell said the total cost of the improvement project would be approximately $21 million. “In effect, this $2 million grant would be a down payment on the rest of the project,” Baine said. “The construction project would be about $19 million total, and what we’re trying to do is keep the taxpayers from paying too much, both now or during the possible construction phase. “The Commissioners Court has already agreed to pay one-third of our $400,000 matching requirement for the $2 million grant, and I anticipate that the City Council will respond favorably to assisting with that matching requirement, as well.” Local considerationsThe lack of safety for current Highway 19 users is another large factor contributing to the project, Baine said. “One person a year is killed, each and ever year, on that highway,” Baine said. “Plus, we have about 54 crashes on that road each year which result in about 47 injuries involving some level of hospitalization. “The people getting hurt are not the old or the very young, but the middle-young, and the accidents are taking place at the times of the day when people go to school.” While environmental studies, cost studies and even land acquisitions have taken place since 1968, no strong action has taken place with regard to Highway 19 until the recent county decision to provide support. “We’re trying to make this issue something the citizens can unite over so pressure an be put on political leaders above the city,” Baine said. “The decision by the Commissioners Court to provide financial support was in many ways unprecedented, but now we have to think about working with Rep. Kevin Brady, state Rep. Lois Kolkhorst and other officials to move forward.” While Baine said nothing is certain with respect to earning the grant, he said he feels earning the grant and getting a set improvement plan in place are good first steps toward eventual construction. “We can’t get in line for construction funding without a design ready, and that’s what this money would get us,” he said. “With a design ready, and with persistence in applying for funds through a variety of different avenues, I’m confident that we’ll be able to go farther with this than we have in the past.”",

    "sentence": "Huntsville man taken into custody after standoff. A Huntsville man was taken into emergency mental health custody Friday afternoon after a three-hour standoff with police in a residential neighborhood. At 12:03 p.m. Walker County dispatchers received a 911 call from a residence in the 1300 block of Avenue Q in Huntsville reporting a suicidal person. The call was made by an elderly woman who reported that her 48-year-old son had locked himself in his bedroom with a rifle and ammunition and was threatening to commit suicide. Officers from the Huntsville Police Department and the Sam Houston State University Police Department responded quickly to the scene and set up a perimeter around the residence. “UPD got several officers there very quickly,” said Lt. Wes Altom of the HPD’s Uniformed Services Division. “Some of their guys were on their way back from lunch when the call came in, and they were able to get there and help us out.” Along with UPD and HPD personnel, Texas Ranger Steve Jeter also responded to the scene and donned tactical gear to assist in securing the exterior of the residence as HPD officers attempted to make contact with the suspect. While officers from both departments worked to remove the suspect’s mother safely from the premises, Altom was able to make contact with the suspect by phone. “I made contact with him and talked with him a little bit,” Altom said. “Contact was sporadic at first. He would hang up, then he would call back. As that was going on we called in Lt. Kevin Lunsford and Sgt. David Collins to assist.” Collins, a trained crisis negotiator, was off-duty at the time of the call, but responded to the scene to establish contact with the suspect. Lunsford, who heads the HPD’s Support Services Division, established a tactical command and called in the department’s Special Response Team (SRT), an eight-officer tactical force specially trained to deal with crisis situations. As the SRT prepared to enter the residence, Collins worked to establish a relationship with the suspect. “You’ve got to build a rapport, but you also have to establish credibility,” Collins said. “You’ve got to be able to do this with sincerity. I was honest with him about what to expect and what we were going to do. He said he wanted some time to think about it.” While Collins continued negotiation with the suspect, the SRT entered the residence and took position outside the suspect’s room, an upstairs bedroom over a carport. “Basically they were outside of a locked door that was at the bottom of the stairs,” Altom said. “It’s a waiting game at that point. The main goal with involving SRT is to contain the suspect so that he doesn’t become a danger to others.” As the standoff continued, more precautions were taken to ensure contact with the suspect could be maintained. Knowing that the suspect was speaking to Collins from a cordless phone, officers were able to bring in a backup negotiation phone by running a phone chord from the SRT’s van to the home’s interior.Commanding officers also took precautions against possible injury, calling in specially trained tactical medics from Huntsville–Walker County EMS. “Tactical medics are not armed, but they’re trained to be close to the action and they help with any immediate need,” Altom said. After nearly three hours of negotiations, at approximately 3:15 p.m., the suspect agreed to surrender himself to police. “Sgt. Collins got him to come down the stairs and unlock the door, and we took him into custody,” Altom said. “I had the opportunity to talk with him afterwards, and he was in very good spirits considering. He was just in a very bad place today, and he knows he needs to get some help.” Two rifles, a lever action and a single shot shotgun, were confiscated from the residence by police. It is unclear if the suspect was in possession of both rifles during the standoff. Police declined to identify the suspect due to the sensitivity of the incident and the fact that he was not charged with a crime. After being taken into custody, he was transported to Huntsville Memorial Hospital for a mental health evaluation. “At that point it will be decided if he’s going to be released or moved to a treatment facility,” Altom said. After a three-hour standoff from which everyone walked away safely, the HPD command staff was pleased with the performance of their officers. “The chief was on scene and commented on the radio at the conclusion that he thought we did a very good job,” Altom said. “It takes a team effort and communication to get a positive outcome and I think we did well. ”“The negotiations were great, and SRT took care of the takedown when the suspect was brought out,” Lunsford said. “It went very smoothly.”",

    "sentence": "Food selections abound at fair. Take a stroll around the Walker County Fairgrounds and your taste buds may start to go a little crazy. Aside from all the attractions and show competitions on slate at the 2009 Walker County Fair, there are plenty of delectable delights to choose from as well, no matter what your preference. Any regular rodeo-goer will be sure to tell you that the traditional stick foods never disappoint. It was a challenge to walk around the fairgrounds and not see at least one person chowing down on some type of tasty treat stuck on a stick. Corn dogs, as long as a man’s forearm, were certainly in abundance. So were chicken on a stick, roasted corn on a stick, and Polish sausage on a stick. Another staple of fair foods, fried foods, also proved that just about anything can be delicious as long it is dipped in a vat of hot oil. South Comfort Foods features fried twinkies, fried Oreos and fried bananas. Is your mouth watering yet? How about the traditional, but always satisfying, funnel cakes topped with powered sugar, fried ice cream or fried fruit pies? These treats are sure to please, especially for those who have a bit of a sweet tooth. Speaking of which, there’s certainly no shortage of cotton candy at the fair. Want to go off the beaten path a little bit and try something that may be a little unconventional as far as rodeo foods go? Then walk on over to the Greek and Italian Grill’s booth for some gyros. There’s also El Cabo’s where you can get Mexican food like taco in a bag for just $2. For those that have trouble resisting seafood, Southern Comfort Foods also has boiled crawfish and peel-n-eat shrimp. Oh, but that’s not all. There’s also turkey legs that are as big as a person’s head and baked potatoes, which are stuffed so much that it could easily pass for a football. What makes the wide variety of odds even better is that just about everything is affordable at around $5 or less. “There’s a lot of food,” said Natalie Gustafson, a junior at Huntsville High School. “You get to eat and you get fat. That’s all that matters. I’ve been here for a long time. The rodeo is always fun. It’s exciting.” “I really like the Italian food,” added Allison Gehovak, a senior at HHS. “The turkey legs are also really good.” While you’re at the fair this week and you feel that grumbling in your stomach, no need to drive back into town, let your tongue have some fun and try some the savory food there at your disposable. You certainly won’t regret it.",

After graduating eleven seniors off of last year's team that lost a Section 2AA Team showdown of top rated teams to Jackson County Central, the Scott West Wrestling team came into the 2007-08 wrestling season with a lot of questions to be answered and on this past Saturday night in Montgomery those questions would be answered as the Panthers stormed their way to a 34-14 team victory over 7th rated Watertown-ML to win the Section 2AA Team championship. \"Personally, I am more proud of this team than any other that I have been associated with as a coach over the last 20 years,\" insists Scott West wrestling coach Darren Ripley. \"They have answered the questions and overcame so much adversity throughout the year that you can't help but feel good about them as a team.\" The Scott West Wrestling team advanced to Saturday night's Section 2AA Team championship meet with a 38-19 win over Hutchinson and a 43-21 win over Delano. However, Team Panther would save their best for last as they rallied from an early ten point team deficit to knock out the Royals from Watertown-ML. \"We have a philosophy within the program that you get stronger as the day goes on,\" comments coach Ripley. \"And our kids certainly carried it out to the mat with them on Saturday night.\" After losing the first three matches to Watertown-ML's trio of good lightweights (Drew Fleming 13-1 over Lee Goldberg, Joey Stadnick 5-0 over Tyler Zilverberg and Brandon Henrich 4-0 over Jake Siegle), it was time for the Scott Wester's to call upon 125 pounder senior Tanner Adamek. \"It's Tanner time!\" exclaims coach Ripley. Adamek went right to work scoring two take downs against Drake Matuska to take a 4-1 first period lead. However, that was just a start of things to come as Adamek scored five more take downs in the second period and then six more in the third period as the Panther wrestler worked his way to a 26-11 technical fall. \"I think Tanner's win brought a lot of energy to our side,\" states coach Ripley. \"And I think it might have cast a little doubt onto the other side.\" The \"Adamek Bomb\" ignited an eight match Panther winning streak that saw Scott West build an insurmountable 28-10 lead through 171 pounds. Junior Mark Dvorak followed the Adamek win with an impressive 9-5 win over Bill McCain at 130. Dvorak opened up his offensive arsenal as he took McCain down twice in each of the first two periods with single legs and duckunders. \"Mark wrestled aggressive and smart,\" suggests coach Ripley. \"It was another big win for him and the team.\" The Panthers would get another big team win at 135 pounds as Tyler Kivel would score a 6-2 win over 6th rated Matt Hirsch. With the scored tied at 2-2 in the third period, Hirsch chose the bottom position to start the third period and that's when Kivel would go to work. The Panther junior rode the Watertown-ML wrestler hard and then cranked him over with a pair of powerful half-nelsons that accounted for two sets of near falls and the win. \"Tyler was close to finishing and scoring on some take downs and that he need to do,\" states coach Ripley. \"He certainly was dominant and tough on top in the third period to get the big win.\" Steamrolling his way to a big win for the Panthers was 140 pounder Tony Valek as the senior scored a 15-0 technical fall over a good sophomore wrestler in Max Poikonen. Valek scored from every position and would widen the gap with reversals and near falls in each of the final two periods. \"Tony is just a complete wrestler,\" sites coach Ripley. \"However, beyond being a complete wrestler, Tony is a great leader and has had a great impact on this team getting to the State Tournament.\" The big wins would keep coming for the Panthers as senior Gabe Dvorak would score a decisive 8-2 win over Jon Dailing at 152 pounds. Dvorak would take a 3-0 lead into the third period and would score a reversal to take a commanding 5-0 lead en route to the victory. \"Gabe really stepped up and wrestled well in the semi final meet against Delano and here in the championship against Watertown-ML,\" responds coach Ripley. \"He wrestled like a Scott West senior with the last name being Dvorak.\" The Dvorak win made it six wins in a row for Scott West and the Panthers would get wins seven and eight not from a Dvorak but from a pair of Fogarty's, cousins Dillon and Connor. Dillion would win a 1-0 rematch over Taylor Neaton at 160 pounds and Connor would do the same with a 4-2 rematch win over Brad Falde at 171. \"They maybe related by blood but their wrestling styles are far from related,\" contends coach Ripley. \"Dillon's going to come straight at you and wrestle you hard with six minutes of basic, fundamental wrestling, while his \"Crazy\" cousin is going take you on roller coaster ride around the mats that you can't even come close to buying at any amusement park in America.\" Watertown-ML's #1 rated Eric Reinert would put an end to the Scott West winning streak as he would down Michael Kroell's at 189 pounds by a score of 16-3. Kroell's, just an 8th grader, put up a good fight and made the Royal wrestler earn his points. \"Michael did a good job of making Reinert earn his points,\" states coach Ripley. \"It's all part of the process and I think some day soon Scott West fans will see Michael Kroells doing the same thing to many of his opponents.\" Senior Alex Krautkremer has been through the process and the Panther wrestler got after Royal wrestler Nate Dickhausen in their third meeting of the year at 215. With the two wrestlers splitting a pair of matches throughout the year, Krautkremer would score early in often in this one as he widened the gap between the two wrestlers by following up a take down with a half nelson that sent Dickhausen to his back, a three-point near fall and an eventual 11-4 Krautkremer win. \"We would have really liked to seen Alex get the pin or the major,\" insists coach Ripley. \"However, this was a very good match for him and it does show that he has been practicing and wrestling well.\" Just a sophomore, Panther heavyweight Travis Hentges has also been wrestling well. Hentges would close out the meet with a solid 6-2 win over Derek Ernst as he used a take down in each of the three periods to win. \"Travis was close to getting some turns and we would have really liked to see that,\" states coach Ripley. \"With that being said, we have really liked the way that Travis has wrestled since the middle of January on.\" Following the Hentges win at heavyweight, the Scott West captains were presented the Section 2AA Team Championship plaque, the enthusiastic Scott West fans flooded the Montgomery gym floor as the State Celebration was on and an echo went throughout all of Scott County: \"We are...SCOTT WEST! ...We are...SCOTT WEST! ...We are...SCOTT WEST!\" Scott West will take to the mats at the St. Paul XCEL Energy Center on Thursday night (February 28th) at 5:00 p.m. with a 27-5 dual meet record this season. The Panthers will face Plainview-Elgin Millville, a team that they beat 45-23 at this year's Clash VI--National Duals in Rochester. \"I don't put too much stock in last time meetings,\" comments coach Ripley. \"There are a lot of variables in high school wrestling and things change, line ups change and you just better have 14 guys that come ready to wrestle if you want to advance to the next round.\" Before the Scott West Wrestling team takes to the mats for their 9th trip to the State Tournament in its 18 year wrestling history, the Panthers will make their way to Delano this weekend for the Section 2AA Individual Tournament with the top two wrestlers in each of the 14 weight classes advancing on to the State Tournament. \"There won't be any free passes,\" states coach Ripley. \"Section 2AA has a long standing history and reputation over the last several years as arguably being the toughest Section in the State, regardless of class.\" The Section 2AA Individual Tournament in Delano will begin with wrestling action at 4:30 p.m. on Friday and at 11:00 a.m. on Saturday. See you at the mat and Go Panthers! Congrats to the team for a group effort. Good luck at the individual tournament this weekend!",

    "sentence": "Ripley's account of Panthers at Belle Plaine. The Scott West wrestling team upped their record to 24-5 in Belle Plaine on Friday night as the Panthers closed out their regular season of wrestling with a 30-21 win over Minnesota's #7 rated team in Class AA, the Watertown-Mayer Lutheran Royals. \"It was a Royal Battle!\" exclaims Scott West Wrestling coach Darren Ripley. With both teams in Section 2AA, the win will most likely give Scott West the number 1 seed heading into this week's Section 2AA Team Tournament that will be held in Montgomery. \"It was a hard fought meet by both teams and we got a good team effort,\" states coach Ripley. \"The #1 is seed is what we wrestled for tonight,\" claims coach Ripley. \"However, a seed does not put you in the State Tournament and that's what we will be wrestling for next week.\" The \"Royal Battle\" would begin with three battles in the lightweight divisions of 103, 112 and 119. Watertown-Mayer Lutheran would come out on the winning end of all three low scoring matches as the Royals got a win from #3 rated Drew Fleming at 103 as he scored a late, third period reversal to win 4-2 over #4 rated Panther Lee Goldberg. The Fleming win was followed by a 2-1 Joey Stadnick win at 112 as the #7 rated Royal wrestler made a first period take down stand up over Panther Tyler Zilverberg. Tenth-rated Brandon Henrich would make it a sweep of the first three weight classes for the visiting Royals as the 119 pounder held on to a 4-2 win over Jake Siegle. \"We knew coming into the meet that there were going to be several close, hard fought matches,\" insists coach Ripley. \"The fight was on!\" After Drake Matuska gave the Royals a 15-0 team lead by pinning Francis Dvorak in the first period at 125, Mark Dvorak would break the scoring ice for the Panthers as he scored a dramatic 5-4 victory over Bill McCain at 130. Trailing 4-3 with just seven seconds left in the match, Dvorak switched McCain for a match winning reversal that gave the Panthers their first three team points of the meet. \"We needed somebody to break the ice,\" comments coach Ripley. \"I would say that is Mark's biggest win for the team since his 8th grade year when he picked up a couple of big team wins over STMA and Milaca.\" The Dvorak win at 152 gave Scott West its first team lead at 18-15 and Dillon Fogarty would close out the Panther six match winning streak pretty much in the same manner as it had started. Trailing Watertown's Taylor Neaton 2-0 late in the match, Fogarty would be awarded one point for a stalling call and then would reverse the Royal wrestler with less than five seconds remaining in the match to get a 3-2 win at 160. \"We always stress that you have to wrestle six minutes and that you have to score the last points of the period,\" states coach Ripley. \"Fortunately, we were able to do that a couple of times tonight.\" The Royals would come back to tie the team score (21-21) at 171 as #1 rated Eric Reinert would score a third period pin of Kyle McDermand. However, the Panthers would come back to win the last three matches of the meet and secure the 30-21 team win behind Connor Fogarty's 4-0 win over Brad Falde at 189, Alex Krautkremer's 3-2 win over Nate Dickhausen at 215 and Travis Hentges 4-0 win over Derek Ernst at heavyweight. \"Again, all three wrestlers stayed in good position and made points hard to come by,\" states coach Ripley. \"Krautkremer's win was especially big because Dickhausen had defeated him earlier at the Christmas Tournament and it gave us an insurmountable six point team lead in this meet.\"",

    "sentence": "Outrage mixes with mourning as three of four victims in Raytown homicide are buried . But instead the two Clemons boys, ages 10 and 7, were snuggled side by side in a casket. Despite it being a perfectly lovely casket — bright white, gold trim and red roses at their feet — this was a heartbreaking sight. Gerard came up shorter, just like on the basketball court. He was only a first-grader, but he had played up so he could be on the same team as his big brother. U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, who spoke at Monday’s funeral for the brothers and their aunt, Precious Triplett, said he didn’t want to hear any talk of the murders being part of God’s plan or that the victims were now in a better place. “God had nothing to do with this!” railed Cleaver, who is a co-pastor of St. James United Methodist Church, where the service was held. Cleaver called the killer an animal and asked that anyone who knew something to step forward and tell police. “If a hyena was running around the neighborhood, everyone would call animal control,” Cleaver told the full church. And then he yelled: “This was not supposed to happen!” The bodies of Amir and Gerard, their 21-year-old aunt and her boyfriend, Andre Jones Sr., 33, were found March 16 in a Raytown apartment. The boys had arrived the night before to spend the night. No arrests have been made in the quadruple homicide. The investigation initially was handled by the Metro Squad but has been turned over to Raytown police, who on Monday made no statement on the case. Detectives have not said when the killings occurred or how the victims died. The boys’ father found the bodies March 16 when he went to the apartment. Triplett was remembered Monday as a young mother who worked hard to improve her life and that of her son. She wanted to become a nurse and worked at a restaurant. Memories of the Clemons brothers were mostly about basketball. They played on a Missouri Valley Blazers fourth-grade team. The team will retire both their numbers. Ten-year-old Amir was a team leader, a high scorer and the quieter of the two. On March 13, he scored 26 points against a team of older players. “He was really hot, so I kept giving him the ball, and he kept making them,” a teammate said in a video played during the service, a tear running down his cheek. “He was really fun to play with, and I wish I had him back.” Gerard — he went by the nickname “Little G” — was more of a talker, aggressive, always ready to shoot a three-pointer. He made his teammates laugh. “He was great in practice until it was time to run laps,” said coach James Price. “Then Gerard would usually need to go get a drink or talk to his mother.” And Little G always used to ask Price whether he could be in the starting lineup. Price will do the best he can to grant that request when the Blazers take the court Friday night. The team will start the game with only three players.",

He found the men early Saturday in Independence, but during an ensuing struggle, the 48-year-old Kansas City man was fatally stabbed in the back. Jackson County prosecutors charged an Independence teenager on Monday with killing Welch and another teen with the stealing that led to Saturday’s fatal confrontation. According to court documents, Welch went to a residence in the 300 block of East Elm Street about 1:45 a.m. Saturday and got into a fight with 19-year-old Anthony Gillen of Kansas City. While they were struggling, 18-year-old Christopher Vasquez allegedly stabbed Welch. Welch and Gillen’s mother, who had accompanied him to the residence, then left in a pickup truck but pulled over near Interstate 435 and 23rd Street and called 911. Gillen and Vasquez were picked up for questioning on Saturday afternoon. Vasquez admitted to police that he and Gillen had stolen property from Welch and that he had stabbed Welch, according to court documents. Gillen told detectives that he was on the ground struggling with Welch when he saw Vasquez approach. Welch then “seemed to lose power and stop fighting.” After Welch and his mother left, Gillen said Vasquez told him that he had stabbed Welch and needed to get rid of the knife. Vasquez later led detectives to where he had hidden the knife and it was recovered, according to the documents. He is charged with second-degree murder and armed criminal action and Gillen is facing a felony stealing charge.",

Attorneys for Linda Rinehart, who appeared in Cass County Circuit Court, also filed a motion to prohibit cameras in the courtroom during pretrial proceedings. Her husband, Danial Rinehart, is accused of having an incestuous relationship with one of the couple’s teenage daughters that lasted five years and produced four babies. He has been charged with second-degree murder, incest, statutory rape, child endangerment and abandonment of a corpse. Authorities say Linda Rinehart knew of the abuse but did nothing to stop it. She is next due in court May 11. One of the babies survived. The boy is in state custody. A firefighter stopped a woman from stealing a battalion chief’s marked vehicle from a fire station about 7:30 p.m. Sunday. After the woman entered the station’s open doors at 1517 Locust Street, a firefighter in the back of the garage told her she was not supposed to be there. The woman jumped into a Fire Department sport utility vehicle and turned the keys in the ignition. The firefighter hopped in the passenger side, turned off the ignition and detained the 24-year-old woman. Police later arrested her. A man has been charged for the role he allegedly played in a car chase in which a Kansas City, Kan., police officer was dragged about 50 feet. Issac Fisher, 26, of Kansas City, Kan., was charged Monday in Wyandotte County District Court with aggravated battery, felony eluding a police officer, disorderly conduct and obstructing the legal process. Fisher was one of three people police arrested Thursday night after a 10-minute car chase that began in Kansas City, Kan., when a police officer was dragged by Fisher’s vehicle, a news release from District Attorney Jerome A. Gorman said. The officer shot the driver of the car, who was caught in the area of Roanoke Park in Kansas City. Police have identified a man who was killed in a shooting early Saturday. Johnny L. Baer, 24, of Kansas City, Kan., was one of three people found shot in the 2400 block of South 13th Terrace. Baer died at the scene.

The two-alarm blaze at the Sunny Hills Apartments & Town Homes was reported just after 9 a.m. as a deck fire in the 1600 block of Northeast Club House Drive. By the time firefighters arrived, one building with about eight units was engulfed in flame. Rose, 28, his 2 1/2-year-old son and his fiancee made it safely outside. “If it wasn’t for my neighbor, I probably would have died of smoke inhalation,” said Rose, who works the overnight shift at a Northland packing facility. “I have to be around for my son,” he said. The wind-fanned fire quickly spread to the second apartment building, where Rose lived. Fire crews from North Kansas City and Kansas City used aerial hoses to pour water on the blaze. The thick, black smoke was visible for miles along Interstate 35. Fire officials did not know how many residents were displaced. Investigators are expected to spend today picking through debris to determine how the fire started. The high winds made for difficult work for the fire crews, said North Kansas City Fire Marshal David Dollins. Two firefighters reported minor injuries, but fire officials knew of no injuries among residents.",

Mike Murphy of the Kansas Highway Patrol said the vehicles overturned in a stretch from Ellsworth to Riley counties. Several people were taken to hospitals with injuries, and several others refused treatment. Most of the vehicles were tractor-trailers and most overturned on Interstate 70. Murphy said in his more than two decades in law enforcement, “I have never seen this many semis blow over.” Wind gusts of more than 60 mph were recorded in Salina, while winds reached speeds of more than 90 mph at a prairie research site about five miles south of Manhattan.",

    "sentence": "Henderson, Boulder City to weigh police, fire facility. The Boulder City Council on Tuesday will consider continuing plans to build a public safety training facility for police and firefighters in the Eldorado Valley. If the council approves a memorandum of understanding with Henderson, the cities will move forward with joint development of the 720-acre training grounds, a project nearly 10 years in the works. Henderson has $1 million set aside for the $6 million project, said Keith Paul, a spokesman for the Henderson Police Department. The agreement wouldn't place any timelines for construction, but it would mean the cities would continue looking for funding in future appropriation bills, Boulder City Manager Vicki Mayes said. \"It's the first step in the process,\" she said. In 2007, Boulder City dedicated $150,000 for the master plan of the training grounds to be built near Silver State Materials off U.S. 95, just north of the dry lake bed, Mayes said. At the council meeting, Poggemeyer Design Group will present that master plan. The facility would have pistol, rifle and shotgun ranges, repelling towers, and a track for emergency vehicle operators to train, Boulder City Police Chief Thomas Finn said. Boulder City and Henderson would allow other police and fire agencies to use the facility for a fee, he said. Mayes said $600,000 for the project recently was recently approved through the Legislature's omnibus bill. Finn said pairing with Henderson on the project is ideal. \"Henderson has money and we have land,\" he said. \"It's a perfect location because it will probably be surrounded some day by solar energy plants, never homes and businesses, so no one will ever complain about the shooting ranges.\"",

    "sentence": "Police shooting in North Las Vegas ruled justifiable. A coroner's inquest ruled today that the fatal police shooting of Tyrise M. Bell on Jan. 23 in North Las Vegas was justified. North Las Vegas Police Officer Michael Eggers shot Bell as the two struggled over a 9mm Beretta handgun Bell pulled from inside his pants. The deadly confrontation between Bell and Eggers came at the end of a foot chase after Bell ran from the officer near the intersection of Revere Street and Ann Road. Eggers, dressed in full police uniform and driving a marked police car with overhead lights activated, tried to stop Bell and another man for jaywalking. The other man has not been identified. The men ran in opposite directions and the other officer chased Bell. Bell ran through two business parking lots and jumped two walls before turning on the officer and striking him in the face with his fist, according to testimony at the inquest. Eggers tackled Bell and a violent fight ensued that tired both men, already exhausted after a run of more than 100 yards. Bell removed a handgun from his pants as Eggers tried to get hold of Bell's hands in the darkness. Feeling the gun, Officer Eggers grabbed it by the top front, just over the barrel. The two fought for control of the weapon before Eggers, beginning to fear he would lose the fight and his life, drew his own gun. Officer Eggers gave commands for Bell to let go of the gun, pressed his own weapon into Bell's back and when that did not stop Bell, Eggers fired five shots, four of which struck Bell. Eggers said he fired until he felt Bell's hand on the gun go limp. Eggers had 16 months experience with the North Las Vegas Police Department at the time of the shooting and, prior to that, five years' experience as a Las Vegas City Marshal.",

    "sentence": "Man recovers after 'killer bee' attack in Silverado Ranch area. A 53-year-old man remained hospitalized Sunday, a day after being stung \"a couple thousand times\" in what authorities are calling the worst bee attack around Las Vegas in 20 years. The man accidentally disturbed a nest of Africanized honey bees, also known as \"killer bees,\" when he overturned a boulder while operating a backhoe, Clark County Fire Department spokesman Scott Allison said Sunday. The incident happened in a Silverado Ranch neighborhood near Spencer Street and Eldorado Lane. He was listed in stable condition Sunday in the intensive care unit at St. Rose Dominican Hospital-Siena campus, hospital spokeswoman Kim Haley said. Haley said the man was stung a couple thousand times, and it was uncertain how long he would have to remain hospitalized. The man was stung on his face, arms, neck and back, Allison said, and firefighters sprayed bees off him with a hose. \"There were so many that they couldn't see the skin on his back when they got to him,\" he told The Associated Press. \"They said it was a black mass of bees on his back continuing to sting him. \"One of the vector control guys with the county said it was the biggest hive he had ever seen. He guessed it weighed about 50 pounds,\" he added. While not native to the U.S., killer bees are well established in southern Nevada. In 2000, a 77-year-old Las Vegas woman was stung about 500 times and survived. In 2003, a horse in Pahrump was killed after being attacked. \"I've been on the department for 20 years and don't remember an attack this bad,\" Allison said. \" (Responders) told me it was like something out of a horror movie.\" Experts urge people under attack to run as fast as possible, saying it's possible to outrun bees if one can run fast and far enough. They also urge people not to jump in swimming pools, saying bees can see people and wait for them there.",

A four-car crash in the northwestern Las Vegas Valley on Monday afternoon left an 82-year-old Las Vegas woman in critical condition, Metro Police said. She was the only person seriously injured in the collisions, police said. A 1996 Oldsmobile 88 driven by Howard Brown, 45, of Las Vegas was going westbound on Vegas Drive in the right of two travel lanes and had a green light, police said. A 1992 Toyota Corolla driven by Mary Lioce was traveling east in the left turn lane to go north on Decatur Boulevard. The Toyota failed to yield the right of way to the Oldsmobile before making the left turn, investigators said. The Oldsmobile was unable to stop before striking the Toyota. The Oldsmobile then was sent north into the southbound lanes of Decatur, where it struck a 2003 Honda Accord, driven by Marisa Huerta, 23 of Las Vegas and passenger Mauro Arellano-Tellez, 23, of San Diego. The Honda was stopped in the left of three southbound lanes and a 2007 Toyota Corolla driven by Gloria Major, 75, of Las Vegas with passenger Barbara Marlowe, 56, of Las Vegas, stopped in the center lane. Lioce, driving the Toyota turning left onto Decatur, was taken to University Medical Center's trauma unit in critical condition, police said. Brown, driver of the Oldsmobile, received minor injuries, police said. None of the others involved in the collisions were injured. The collision is under investigation by the Metro Police Accident Investigation Detail.",

    "sentence": "Site of proposed casino near Chinatown going to auction. Developers are planning to sell 22 acres near Chinatown – the site of a proposed Asian-themed casino – at a bankruptcy auction May 16. The site of the proposed Dragon City Hotel and Resort is bound by Valley View Boulevard, Spring Mountain Road, Wynn Road and Desert Inn Road. The land took seven years to assemble and is zoned for a 28-story, 2,200-room hotel with 500,000 square feet of gaming, restaurant, entertainment and meeting space, according to a press release issued by Chartwell Group, which is overseeing the auction. The sale, subject to approval by a bankruptcy court judge, is a \"highly strategic opportunity for buyers to acquire a fully entitled casino site in an unparalleled location,\" Michael E. Berland, executive vice president and principal of Chartwell Group’s Accelerated Marketing Division, said in a statement. Bidding will start at $27.5 million. The Dragon City resort is one of multiple proposals for Asian-themed casinos in Las Vegas that have not come to fruition. Even before the recession, financing for off-Strip casinos by industry newcomers was difficult at best. In an interview with In Business Las Vegas in 2006, businessman Andrew Lai said his proposed resort had the potential to draw Asian tourists from the Strip and would be a place where Asians – a growing segment of casino customers – would feel at home.",

Easterday termed the event, “the giving of the green on St. Patrick’s Day.” The presentation was of “dedicated” funds — money from specific endowments supervised by the CFBC for specific organizations. “The foundation exists to bring people who care together with causes that matter,” Easterday said. He said the breakfast was “a prime example of the synergy” between donors and needs in Boone County. “If we can continue to match up donors with items of concern to them ... we can do this for many, many years,” Easterday said. Public schools were the biggest beneficiaries Tuesday. The Zionsville Education Foundation, established in 1995 by the Glassier Memorial Fund and the ZEF’s founders, received $26,217.

    "sentence": "Lebanon schedules spring clean-up. Residents again have a chance to clean up yards, nooks, under kitchen sinks and medicine cabinets. Days have been designated to discard leaves, limbs and other yard debris; to dispose of unneeded over-the-counter and prescription medicines and to set out trash too bulky to be left at curbside on a regular trash collection day. Yard cleanup days are April 6-9 and April 13-17, Lebanon Street Superintendent Larry Lee said. “This is not,” Lee said, “an invitation for somebody to cut down a tree.” Leaves should be raked to curbside and separated from tree limbs, he said. A “household haz-mat” disposal day sponsored by the Boone County Solid Waste District Management Board will be 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. May 16, the board decided at a recent quarterly meeting. A haz-mat day will be scheduled this fall in Zionsville, Waste District Director Dave Lamm said. Lebanon’s semi-annual heavy trash disposal day is 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. April 24-25 at the street department, 1301 Lafayette Ave., Lebanon. Only city residents may participate, Lee said. Only household items will be accepted. That excludes railroad ties, fences, construction debris, tires, oil-based paint and hazardous materials. There’s no cost, Lee said. Ray’s Trash, which has the city’s trash collection contract, and Gabriel Metals, a Lebanon recycling company, will again help with the clean-up, Lee said. Ray’s will provide Dumpsters and containers for bulk metal, Lee said. Gabriel Metals will haul away appliances, including refrigerators, air conditioners and water heaters, at no cost. The only condition is that compressors be removed from refrigerators.",

    "sentence": "New twist develops in Fairfield hearing. A new plea agreement is “at least being discussed” for Elizabeth Fairfield, a Lebanon woman accused of murdering her daughter, Brittany, in June 2007. Robert Schembs, one of four lawyers on Fairfield’s defense team, told Superior Court II Judge Rebecca McClure a deal was possible during an initial hearing Thursday. “I think if we resolve it, it will be sooner rather than later,” Schembs said. Specifics will follow Thursday’s hearing, he told McClure. Initial hearings are when defendants formally learn what crimes they are accused of committing. Fairfield was already in jail after being indicted by a Circuit Court grand jury in November 2008 for allegedly giving Brittany a lethal dose of tramadol, a prescription pain killer. Additional charges of reckless homicide, neglect of a dependent and lying to police were filed against Fairfield on March 16. McClure gave attorneys until 11 a.m. April 24, when an hearing to review evidence is scheduled, to approve a plea agreement. Fairfield’s trial is to start at 8:30 a.m. May 4 and last five days. McClure said she anticipates the trial “would require substantially more jurors” than usually called for in a Superior II trial. “It costs us more than $1,000 just to get a jury here,” she said. Fairfield’s lawyers have already tried to keep the new charges from being field and still question whether the new charges are “technically legal,” Schembs said. There are “propriety issues” over the grand jury’s indictment, he said. “We’re not sure at this point what they were presented with and what they weren’t; what they did and what they didn’t,” Schembs said. McClure had rejected a motion to strike the new charges, saying the defense had based the request on an out-dated state law. “A new motion to strike is pending,” Schembs said. If the new charges stand, and if she is convicted on all four counts, Fairfield could spend up to 98 years in prison and be fined $35,000. Fairfield has rejected one plea agreement. On Jan. 20, Prosecutor Todd Meyer offered to have her confess to reckless homicide. If she had accepted, and agreed to attend parenting and prescription drug treatment classes, Fairfield would have been released that day. Fairfield declined to plead, maintaining her innocence.",

Jolly, who has no prior arrest record in Boone County, was taken into custody by Lebanon Police after a 5 p.m. Thursday traffic stop, LPD Lt. Brent Wheat said in a press release. He was formally arrested later Thursday after an interview with LPD detectives, Wheat said. Child pornography is a class D felony, which carries a sentence of up to three years in prison. Jolly, who gave addresses in the 700 block of East Washington Street and the 400 block of Elm Street, was held on $505 bond in the Boone County Jail. Lebanon Police and the Boone County Sheriff’s Office began an investigation after a Boone County 911 dispatcher said Jolly might have illegal images on a computer. Detectives from both agencies worked on the investigation, LPD Chief Tom Garoffolo said. Police confiscated “a large amount of computer equipment and other items” at three locations, Wheat said.",

    "sentence": "Unemployment climbs slightly in county, state. Boone County’s unemployment rate reached 7.7 in February. That number is less that the national and state average, but it is a 6 percent increase from January. According to information released Friday by the Indiana Department of Workforce Development, Boone County’s unemployment rose from 7.3 percent in January to 7.7 in February. State unemployment was 9.4 percent in February and the national rate for that month was 8.1 percent. Boone County’s rate places it in the middle of surrounding counties. According to Bureau of Labor Statists data, neighboring counties and their rates include: Hamilton, 6 percent; Hendricks, 7.3 percent; Marion, 8.7 percent; Montgomery County, 9.1 percent, and Clinton, 10.5 percent. Boone County has a workforce of 27,733 and in February, 25,588 individuals were employed, compared to 2,145 out of work. At 7.7 percent unemployment, Boone County’s figure is near the middle of Indiana counties — it was 42nd of the state’s 92 counties. An overview of the stateIndiana’s unemployment rate grew slightly in February to 9.4 percent, keeping the state’s jobless rate at the highest level since the recession of the early 1980s. February’s jobless report shows 324,000 Indiana residents looking for work — about 4,000 more than in January. That pushed the state’s jobless rate up slightly from January’s 9.3 percent. February’s numbers suggest that an increase in heavy construction jobs amid the lingering recession is starting to offset continued drops in auto manufacturing, said Teresa Voors, commissioner of the Indiana Department of Workforce Development. “We expect to see continued growth as outdoor construction resumes, but this may not completely negate extended furloughs and layoffs in the automobile industry in the coming months,” Voors said. Indiana’s 0.1 percentage-point February jobless increase was the smallest among it and neighboring states. Illinois reported the largest increase, up 0.8 points to 8.6 percent. Ohio’s rose 0.6 points to 9.4 percent, while Kentucky’s climbed 0.5 points to 9.2 percent. Michigan’s rate climbed 0.4 points to 12.0 percent. February’s national jobless rate was 8.1 percent.",

The Lebanese Army and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) dispatched teams to look into the incident, which drew protests from the southern residents. Tuesday's flooding is part of a systematic practice by the Israeli authorities to turn the highly-fertile land into swamps by channeling rainwater into the fields via trenches, which were dug for that purpose. The Lebanese Army and UNIFIL have tried to block the water channels to protect the crops. Separately, UNIFIL's media coordinator, Dhalia Farran, reiterated calls for Israel to hand over official maps detailing where the Israeli army dropped cluster bombs during the summer 2006 war.",

    "sentence": "AMEL center offers breathing space to Iraqi refugees . One of the first projects the committee hopes to start is the production of an information pack that contains advice and information useful to the refugee community. Once compiled, they hope to distribute this leaflet to some of the estimated 40,000 Iraqi refugees and many other refugees from Ethiopia, the Philippines, Sudan and Syria, who are not currently registered with the UNHCR. BEIRUT: \"You know, the life of a refugee in Lebanon is such a difficult one,\" explains Haidar. \"We are treated as undesirables, as trouble-makers, even as terrorists. Society is hostile toward us and the authorities don't recognize us as equals; we suffer from abuse, exploitation and the constant fear of arrest.\" The association believes that one of the primary benefits of the center is that it provides refugees with an opportunity to participate directly in the running of the services provided by the NGO. This participatory approach relies on a commitment to allowing refugees to take direct responsibility for the provision and maintenance of services. This week, AMEL took steps in realizing this vision, by organizing a democratic vote to elect a Youth Committee to represent the interests of the NGO's six hundred plus beneficiaries, the first of its kind in Lebanon. He goes on to say that even those refugees who are registered with the UNHCR and possesses UN papers are not safe, seeing as the Lebanese authorities do not recognize the status of refugees and will arrest and detain anyone who is caught. As a result, Sajed concludes, \"many refugees cannot travel, but must remain in or close to their homes in [Beirut's southern suburbs], where the local security forces are sympathetic to their situation.\" The committee hopes that by becoming elected representatives, they can help to break the sense of isolation felt by refugees. Sajed explains the importance of the AMEL center as a safe space where people can meet and relax. \"It is a place where we are able to do the sorts of everyday things that, as refugees, we are normally deprived of.\" Committee members all agree that it is through being at the center, making friends, sharing experiences, offering and asking for advice and engaging in dynamic activities that people are able to stop thinking about themselves as refugees and start to live more normal lives. A combination of this community-based mentality and a participatory approach can be seen in action through the educational and vocational training programs provided by the AMEL center. Instead of recruiting staff from outside, the center aims to recruit trainers and teachers directly from the Iraqi refugee community. For example, one of the committee members, Sajed, a long-term refugee in Lebanon, works at the center as an Arabic literacy and history teacher. Sajed hopes that by reaching out to the community, they will find other people with skills who are willing to share them. This way, Sajed hopes, the community will be able to provide for its own needs rather than being reliant on external help.",

As a non-native of Lebanon, one might ask what makes mothers the object of so much ardent affection on this annual holiday. Mawla thinks it's because \"she is more close to her children compared to mothers in other countries because she spends more time with them.\" Many appreciated the strength their mothers showed during their childhoods, especially those who grew up during the 1975-1990 Civil War. \"The way she took care of us and protected us during the Civil War was amazing ... she made us feel there was nothing to be scared of. When I was little she would hug me when they were bombing and tell me it was just a game ... and that when I grew up Lebanon would be a better country,\" said Ahmed Hamade about his mother, Fatima. Others cited their mother's constant and vocal concern with their well-being as the cornerstone of their appreciation. Maria Hrawi said she loves her mother Eliana for \"always being there when I need her ... I know I'm always in her thoughts and I never feel alone.\"",

But Schiff surprised everyone by declining to accept any salary increase this year, the last year of his contract, which ends June 2010. “He had already told us he would accept half the contractual increase but we were taken completely by surprise when he announced he would give up any increase at all,” said Deb Labbadia, the board president. “I felt like it is the right thing to do,” said Schiff on March 6. “These are difficult economic times.

Maira said she had spoken with planning consultant Frank Banish and had been advised that pools had not been included as an accessory use when the area was zoned about 10 years ago because the plan at the time had called for high-density condominiums, not the single family homes that were eventually built. Cimei said the ordinance amending the regulations would be considered by the council next month, but would have to be referred to the Planning Board before it can be fully adopted. The timeline may take final adoption well into May, further delaying potential pool construction. Depending on when the work can be done, the five hopeful residents may have to wait well into the summer months before realizing the cooling effect of their swimming pools.",

Township Attorney Michael Selvaggi said that a special event permit is meant for “informational purposes” to give township police or the local fire department notice that a larger event will be taking place in the township. He added that the township has no discretion to grant denial outside of health and safety issues related to the event. However, the ordinance does state that any applicant must show all taxes, fees, fines, and all other outstanding financial obligations to the township have been paid. Furthermore, no permit will be issued to a landlord if there are outstanding governmental, zoning, construction, or fire code violations against the person or the property in question. An application for the permit must be received by the township clerk at least 45 days prior to the event and is subject to review by the township police chief, fire official, health officer, zoning officer, construction officer, and township engineer for compliance with ordinances, laws, requirements, and regulations. The applicant would require additional approvals or permits from regulatory and government agencies where jurisdiction applies, such as the N.J. Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control or the state Department of Environmental Protection. According to the ordinance, the township, the Board of Education, and township volunteer emergency services may request a waiver from the township administrator from the requirements of the permit if they are sponsoring an event. . - The Township Committee introduced an ordinance on special events permits last Tuesday, March 10, that states a non-fee permit must be obtained for any event with 50 or more people on public or private property. However, private parties, celebrations, and gatherings that take place on private property and are invitation-only will be exempt from the permit requirement. The designated number of people includes participants, spectators, employees, caterers, and anyone else present at the event. The hours of operation for all special events will be from 9 a.m. until 11 p.m.The public hearing on the ordinance is scheduled for Tuesday, April 14.",

    "sentence": "City Hall Digest . London city council will hire outside experts to defend itself and its rejection of a proposed medical clinic and pharmacy in north London. Developers who wanted to build the project on Richmond Street along the Uplands have appealed to the Ontario Municipal Board. City staff supported the development as did a minority on council, who pointed to new jobs, doctors, tax assessment and construction but they were out-voted by council members who said the development would betray the nearby community and a neighbourhood plan that placed retail across busy Richmond Street, London city council rejected creating a formal policy to seek partnerships with “sister cities” around the world. Advocates argues the relationship would put London in a better position to benefit from the global economy. But those opposing that step argued it would create unnecessary costs and bureaucracy and would place the city in a position of not being able to meet its obligations  the city has done little to sustain a previous “sister city” relationship with Quebec City and Nanjing, China. The issue of sister cities surfaced last year when Controller Gord Hume asked for $1,200 to visit Nanjing while on a personal trip to Beijing. Facing a backlash from some council members, Hume withdrew his request. Londoner will get a chance in May to weigh in on the future of the cit’s board of control. A public participation meeting will be held at 4 p.m. May 14 at Centennial Hall. Council has already recommended scrapping the board and dividing its functions after the 2010 civic election between two new committees of ward councillors.",

    "sentence": "Laurel County clerk honored at Lincoln Dinner. With her stunning red hair flaming, Rebecca Mays cozily sat on her papaw’s lap Saturday night, listening to Kentucky’s top politicos make rousing speeches at the Lincoln Day Dinner. But soon it was her grandfather’s own turn to take to the stage. And when Laurel County Clerk Dean Johnson was inducted into the 5th District’s Lincoln Club Hall of Fame, he beamed at his smiling granddaughter. Johnson was one of four inductees — and the only Laurel County resident — welcomed into the prestigious club Saturday. “I feel good about it, naturally,” he said of the honor. Johnson joins fellow inductees state Sen. Tom Jensen, R-London; former commonwealth’s attorney Tom Handy and former senator Gene Huff. But Johnson said he wasn’t sure what clinched the honor for him. “I really don’t know,” he said. “I’ve always tried to help and support the people who run for state and federal offices. I suppose it’s because I’ve tried to be a strong supporter.” Johnson entered the political arena himself in the early 1970s when he ran for sheriff at the age of 31. “I thought there was some room for some younger people,” he said. Though he was defeated by 9 votes, Johnson was immediately hooked to the political game and, soon thereafter, made a bid to fill the county clerk seat. Again, he was narrowly defeated but not discouraged. In 1985, he won the clerk’s seat and has occupied it ever since. Through it all, he has been a staunch Republican supporter, voting for Republican presidents and governors ever since he cast his first vote for Richard Nixon in 1960 at the age of 18. Johnson said he’s admired many Republican presidents in his lifetime, including Dwight Eisenhower. “He was the greatest and the best we ever had,” he said. “I was about 10 and we studied about him. I think he did a lot to bring this nation into the modern era.” Since, Johnson said he has been a fan of Ronald Reagan and “believe it or not, I thought the Bushes did a fine job. ”“You’ve got to understand the conditions they’re serving under,” he said. “I think we have to look at the times before we can be critical of anyone.” Of Saturday’s dinner, Johnson said he enjoyed speeches given by Senate President David Williams, U.S. Rep. Harold “Hal” Rogers and U.S. Sens. Mitch McConnell and Jim Bunning. “I thought the content of them was good,” he said. “They didn’t get into specifics about a contested race that they might have in the primary. I thought they limited their speech to what they were doing and what they want to see done.” In terms of the future of the Republican party, Johnson is optimistic. “I think they have to sit back and wait,” he said. “There will be situations they can take advantage of. I think in two years, there will be a reversal. I think people will want conservative values back.”",

Brent Ching, his wife Kristen and his children, Hailey, 6, and Caleb, 4, all of whom died in the crash, were related to the late Dr. Caleb Chu, who worked as a physician at Oneida Mountain Hospital for more than 30 years. Brent Ching was Chu’s grandson. Chu’s widow and Ching’s stepgrandmother, Priscilla, has lived in London for more than 30 years. Priscilla Chu said the family was flying from Oroville, Calif., to Montana for a ski trip. Chu said the Chings were avid skiers. “Even the little ones skied,” she said. Chu said she heard about what happened while watching the news on TV. “When they mentioned Oroville, it clicked,” she said. Brent Ching, a dentist, was the son of Phyllis Chu, Caleb Chu’s daughter. While Phyllis Chu was raised in Clay County, Ching grew up in California. His uncle Perry Chu, who attended Laurel County High School, also lives out west. Priscilla Chu said she spoke to Perry, an anesthesiologist, Sunday. “He was in bad shape and was in shock,” she said. As to how she felt, Priscilla Chu just answered, “How would you feel?” Chu visited the Ching family in August and said the kids were a joy. “They were so young, they loved everybody,” she said. Seven of the 14 killed in the crash were believed to be children who ranged in age from 1 to 9. Around 11:30 a.m. Sunday, the plane was headed to Bozeman, Mont., but rerouted suddenly to Butte. The PC-12, which was built in 2001, nose-dived into Holy Cross Cemetery, just 500 feet short of the runway at Butte’s Bert Mooney Airport. Reports Tuesday showed ice might have been a factor in the crash. There were no survivors. Staff writer Tara Kaprowy can be reached by e-mail at tkaprowy@sentinel-echo.com.",

Last day of school for Laurel County students scheduled for June 5; graduation set June 6 if state approves The last day of school for Laurel County School District students will be June 5 and graduation will be June 6, pending approval from the Kentucky Department of Education. Director of Pupil Personnel Rhonda Welch said the district will ask the Kentucky Department of Education to forgive one of its 13 missed school days this year, which will allow the June 5 end date. “We can apply for one day,” Welch said. “The lady at KDE said the same thing.” The rest of the missed days that were not covered under banked time will be made up. The last day of school was originally scheduled for May 27. Welch said muddling through the details of House Bill 322, which allows districts to apply for missed days, hasn’t been easy. “Developing the amended calendar this year has been somewhat of an adventure,” she admitted. Welch said the commissioner has 10 days to respond to the request. If it is denied, Superintendent David Young said going to school on Memorial Day is an option. “That’s the only day we can take,” he said. “If we did lose another day, it gives us another option, but still keep graduation June 6.” Motion was approved by Joe Schenkenfelder, seconded by Bud Stuber and unanimously approved. Following the motion, Hacker Brothers Construction Manager David Jackson told School Board members Phase I of the North Laurel High School renovation — which involves replacing the heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems this summer — will be “severely affected” by the calendar change. Business Manager Jim Kennedy said he would speak with Jackson and Superintendent David Young to arrive at some type of arrangement. In other action, School Board members: Approved design development drawings for Phase II of North Laurel High School. The multi-million dollar renovations to the school will involve adding four classrooms to its northwest corner, upgrading bathrooms, fixing the roof, replacing the ceiling in the auditorium, fixing doors leading to the gym and enclosing the front canopy.

    "sentence": "Laurel County prepares for PRIDE Spring Cleanup. April is PRIDE Spring Cleanup Month in southern and eastern Kentucky. Local cleanup activities are being organized by Laurel County PRIDE coordinator Jim Ed McDaniel and London PRIDE coordinator Steve Edge. “PRIDE wants you,” said Karen Engle, PRIDE president and chief executive officer. “That’s our theme for the 2009 Spring Cleanup because our goal is 20,000 volunteers region-wide. This is a big territory, and we need that many volunteers to make it look its best. .” PRIDE coordinators are volunteers who play a vital role in building PRIDE in their communities. The coordinators work with the PRIDE staff to organize cleanup activities, recruit volunteers and track cleanup results. They assist local officials with the programs of PRIDE, a nonprofit organization that promotes environmental cleanup and education in 38 counties. PRIDE coordinators are planning each community’s Spring Cleanup activities. Throughout April, volunteers will pick up roadside litter and beautify welcome areas. PRIDE will give each volunteer a free T-shirt, as well as supply their trash bags, gloves and vests. PRIDE will help local governments pay for trash disposal and beautification projects. Hundreds of volunteers are needed for several large cleanup events in the Laurel County area. On April 4, volunteers will pick up trash along KY 90 near Cumberland Falls State Resort Park during the PRIDE Spring Cleanup Kickoff. On April 18, the annual Laurel Lake Cleanup will be held. The annual Woods Creek Lake Cleanup will be April 25. April is also Redbud Month, and freshly cleaned roads will welcome the tourists who want to enjoy the region’s native Eastern Redbud trees. Redbud Month is sponsored by TOUR Southern and Eastern Kentucky, which is the region’s tourism development organization and PRIDE’s partner in making our region a more beautiful place to call home. Qualifying communities will receive hundreds of redbud seedlings from TOUR SEKY and eight-feet-tall redbud trees from PRIDE. Redbud Month information is available at ww.tourseky.com or by contacting Michelle Spencer at mspencer@tourseky.com or 677-6142. To volunteer for the PRIDE Spring Cleanup in Laurel County, contact McDaniel at 878-6845 or lcsolidwaste@alltel.net. London residents can reach Edge at 864-5521.",

    "sentence": "Audit alleges discrepancies with emergency director over $1.8 million grant. Audit alleges discrepancies with emergency director over $1.8 million grant After an audit revealed he misspent $1.87 million in federal funds — much of which went into the coffers of his wife’s company — Brian Reams has been fired from his position as director of the division of public safety and emergency management. The audit also blames the Laurel County Fiscal Court for lack of oversight. The audit has been referred to the Kentucky Attorney General’s Office, the FBI and the United States Department of Homeland Security. Reams did not respond to a request for comment. Laurel County Judge-Executive Lawrence Kuhl fired Reams at the Emergency Operations Center and asked him to leave the building Tuesday morning. “Naturally, I hate the whole situation,” Kuhl said. “I wasn’t aware of it. None of us were aware of it until their findings. It’s a tough decision that has to be made by us and by me.” Fourth-district magistrate Jeff Book expressed his disapproval. “I’m very disappointed in someone of Mr. Reams’ status, with the magnitude of his position as the EMS director, director of CSEPP, homeland security, just the magnitude of his office, spending federal tax dollars coming into the county for emergency operations and the protection of our citizens being spent for what appears to be other reasons,” he said.Second-district magistrate Tom Baker echoed Book’s sentiment. “I feel anger, disappointment that our county has been dragged into this,” he said. The audit, released by state auditor Crit Luallen’s office, reported the Laurel County Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program received the $1.8 million grant so Reams could buy specific equipment for 10 Kentucky counties. Reams reportedly received two bids for the project, which he opened alone, rather than going through the fiscal court. The contract was ultimately awarded to PREP, a business owned by Melody Vess Reams. Melody Vess and Brian Reams married in June 2008. The equipment purchased by PREP — Providing Response and Emergency Preparedness — was far inferior to what was supposed to be bought as per the grant’s specifications. For example, the project called for 40, 8,000-watt generators but PREP delivered 40, 3,000-watt generators. “Based on Internet research for comparable prices, it appears that the invoice also overcharged for these generators by as much as $900 each,” the audit reads. “It appears CSEPP overpaid at least $35,402 for these generators.” The grant also called for the purchase of 40, 7 foot-by-18 foot Homesteader trailers. Instead, PREP delivered 40 LA Cargo trailers. “Questions were raised by one county CSEPP coordinator as to whether these were even new trailers due to deteriorated conditions in some areas,” the report reads. Gary Epperson, CSEPP director for Clark County, was taken aback by the equipment he received. “I was one of the people who was a little surprised we weren’t getting what we thought we were getting,” he said. “We were under the impression that we couldn’t get what we wanted. That’s what we were told. It was indicated at some meetings that we were having a cost overrun.” Epperson said Clark County’s trailer looked new but “it wasn’t the brand we thought we were getting. ”“I think everybody was concerned it wasn’t exactly what we expected to get,” he said. “The generators were the thing that stood way out. They weren’t really strong enough to power the equipment.” Nevertheless, PREP submitted an invoice asking for $530,446 to pay for supplies. CSEPP Public Information Officer Monica French said questions arose about the grant in August 2008, shortly after CSEPP Program Coordinator Mark Klaas and Kentucky Department of Emergency Management Director Brig. Gen. John Heltzel took over. French said the issue was brought to their attention immediately. “We cooperated completely with the auditors,” French said. “We want to ensure to everyone we are trying to make this right. That’s why we go in and inventory everything now. They will go and look at the property and check it out. We are putting new policies and procedures in place.” The Luallen audit was based on one performed by London-based Christian, Sturgeon & Associates, whose report questioned the entire cost related to the $1.87 million grant. However, the Christian report also places blame on the Laurel County Fiscal Court, saying it “did not properly oversee the bid process, bid award and procurement process. ”“As a result, improprieties occurred,” it reads. The report states, “bids for materials, supplies or equipment must be obtained for expenditures that exceed $20,000.” In the case of the grant, the bids did not even go through the fiscal court. In its finding, the Christian report said the court “should not engage in related party transactions.” The audit shows in May 2008 a purchase request was forwarded from Reams to the fiscal court for the purchase of parts and maintenance in the amount of $9,996.15. “The purchase requisition was pending at the time the Director (Reams) became married to the owner of PREP,” it reads. Allison Martin, spokeswoman for the Kentucky Attorney General’s office, said they have not yet received a copy of the audit, but will review it once they do. If warranted, charges would be filed in the coming weeks. Kevin Pickering, external affairs officer in FEMA Region IV, said FEMA is taking a wait-and-see approach. “It’s primarily a state issue at this point,” he said. “FEMA has and will continue to support the commonwealth of Kentucky as it investigates alleged misuse of CSEPP funds in Laurel County. Based on the results of that investigation, when it’s finished, FEMA will assess further action.” Staff writer Tara Kaprowy can be reached by e-mail at tkaprowy@sentinel-echo.com.",

Those were just a few of the bits of knowledge the 18 teams participating in the 11th annual Laurel County Adult Education and Literacy Trivia Bee were asked in their quest to take home the really big trophy. When the smoke cleared, the HSBC Juggernauts, Dale Crandall, John Matthews and Jason Jones, took home first place. As they celebrated their victory with some of their fellow HSBC employees, they admitted it was not all smooth sailing. “We had our lowest score with the SEC questions and we were fortunate with the Monopoly questions to make some good guesses,” Jones said. The team vowed they will return in 2010 to defend their title. Kathryn Hardeman, executive director of Laurel County Adult Education and Literacy, said the event raised $3,750 for the organization. “That money is used to pay for scholarships,” Hardeman said. “Most of the grant money we receive is marked for specific projects.

    "sentence": "Church & State in downtown Los Angeles. The bar section at Church & State, a new restaurant in downtown Los Angeles, has a recipe written on a column for drinking absinthe. The restaurant is in the National Biscuit Co. building. If you tried the restaurant when it opened and were disappointed, let me just say this: After a rocky start that ended in the original chef leaving, the restaurant is really humming. Manzke is throwing himself into the bistro genre with gusto. He's making his own charcuterie. He's changing the menu every few days. He's in the zone. For anyone looking for a restaurant downtown that has good food, and feels festive and fun, all without straining the pocketbook too much, that place is Church & State. Manzke is working like someone possessed. He's the guy in the open kitchen with the flattop haircut and an old-fashioned kind of face that wouldn't look out of place on the AMC series \"Mad Men.\" Hands-on all the way, he's even crafting his own hardwood cutting boards for the charcuterie and cheese platters. Originally the loading dock of the 1925 National Biscuit Co. building, the one big dining room has a funky festive look with piazza lights strung across the high ceilings with visible pipes and ducts. Old mirrors and chairs with red leather seats complete the bistro look and tall windows look out onto Industrial Street and the Toy Factory Lofts across the street. The neighborhood can be dicey, but this precious little block is full of life in the dark -- loft dwellers walking their dogs, downtown folks bicycling home, high heels clicking on the sidewalks. With the spangled lights reflected in the windows across the way, this tiny section of the city begins to take on some of the industrial chic of the meatpacking district in New York. The clatter and bang from the kitchen competes with the music pumping out from the sound system -- all you feel is the beat: it's hard to tell what it is. But nobody seems to care: They're too busy eating and drinking, big groups of six or eight friends crowded in at one table, or couples strung out at small tables along the back wall. At one, a slender girl in a tight black vest, short skirt and black stockings toasts her companion and digs into an iced platter of oysters. They're Kumamotos and Kushis from the Northwest, nice and cold, fresh and delicious. Dishes to share The server madly pushes candles, plates, glasses away to clear a space in the middle of the table for the charcuterie presented on a foot-and-a-half-long cutting board. Most of it is made in-house -- lovely rounds of rabbit galantine studded with pistachios, a delicate partridge terrine with truffles, (pig's feet and Kurobuta ham with parsley pressed into a rectangle), slivers of deep red duck breast prosciutto (not all of them are available every day). Manzke also turns out French canning jars filled with pork rillettes (pork cooked in pork fat that's rather on the lean side here) topped with prunes and Armagnac, and fabulously silky and rich foie gras with a layer of Port gelée on top. There's peppery , a large rectangular tart topped with sweet caramelized onions, cubes of bacon and Gruyère cheese rather than the traditional crème fraîche. It's essentially a tomato-less pizza with bacon. What's not to like? More sumptuous even is the tart blanketed in lemon crème fraîche, leeks and satiny smoked salmon. Not only is the topping terrific, the crust for both the tarts is thin and crunchy. The secret? The pastry is enriched with a little lard. And both tarts are so large, they're too much for just two. Bring a few friends along and share as an appetizer. And sharing is what most makes sense here. Everyone will want to taste everything. Plates fly around the table as someone wants to try the bouillabaisse, which is a kind of miracle. The broth actually tastes like something from the south of France, redolent of flavorful fish and loaded with prawns, mussels and clams. If you're in a crowd, maybe you'd better get two: The portion isn't huge, which is why they can charge just $18. fried in lard, which gives them a wonderful flavor, even though the aioli that comes with them is too wimpy. How can you not love a bistro that proposes herring and potato salad? In this case it's smoked, marinated herring with boiled fingerling potatoes in a bright, vinegary dressing, with flower-shaped carrot slices for some crunch. Sometimes there's a marvelous leek terrine, pretty and green, and served with a thatch of celery root salad. Don't pass up the escargots, an order of six, each served in an adorable tiny blue and white porcelain dish capped with a golden disk of puff pastry. There are plenty to share -- or maybe not, once you dip your spoon into that garlicky snail butter and find out how good snails can be when made by somebody who really knows how to cook. Keeping it simple Manzke has wisely stripped the menu down to a single page, with most main courses under $20. Even the very decent steak frites, which come with house-made béarnaise, come in a smaller size -- a for a mere $14 as opposed to $24 for the regular. We're all seeking comfort food right now and chicken à la Bourgeoise is just what's required, moist tender chicken roasted with carrots, pearl onions and bacon and served with a splash of the pan drippings. Manzke does a fine duck confit too, served with luscious braised red cabbage.",

But the mood at the Los Angeles high school where he held a town hall meeting Thursday was an upbeat mix of rock concert and campaign event. Vendors sold T-shirts, buttons, framed photos and baby onesies; one enterprising young woman advertised \"Presidential Concessions\" -- bottled water for $1. Tickets to the event at the campus just west of downtown were free and mostly given away through an online lottery. Some later ended up for sale on the Internet. Liz Bramhall's father bought her ticket on craigs list.com for $300. \"I just wanted to see history,\" said the 20-year-old Camarillo resident. \"I'll have memories to tell my kids and my grandkids.\" Paula Starr, 54, was visibly moved during Obama's speech.",

    "sentence": "Missing Lancaster girl's body is found as mother's story unravels. A chilling report that a Lancaster mother had been knocked unconscious by an attacker and her 18-month-old daughter abducted Wednesday afternoon triggered a frantic search by authorities for the missing child. That search ended nearly a dozen hours later Thursday, though, when police discovered the toddler's body dumped by the side of a road in Sylmar, near the Golden State Freeway. Now, in the wake of the discovery, investigators are saying there are problems with the mother's explanation. Emma Leigh Barker's remains were found by investigators after they determined there \"were several inconsistencies\" with her mother's story, authorities said. The girl's body was found near Roxford Street and El Dorado Avenue, concealed by deep overgrown brush alongside a fence. Authorities said it appeared the girl's 25-pound body had been dumped sometime over the last 24 hours and showed no visible signs of trauma. The girl's mother, Stacy Barker, 20, initially told detectives that she was at a Lancaster park next to the Antelope Valley Freeway about 5 p.m. and had placed Emma in her car seat. The mother said she was \"struck from behind by an unknown assailant\" and knocked unconscious, sheriff's homicide Lt. Pat Nelson said. Barker insisted to detectives she awoke about 10:30 p.m. several miles away at a Palmdale park-and-ride on Avenue S and her daughter was missing. The mother's brother called authorities, and deputies were dispatched to the park-and-ride lot. Deputies found the mother semiconscious and partly undressed with visible bruises on her head, Nelson said. The Sheriff's Department began searching for the girl at 11 p.m. Wednesday. Investigators put out a description of the girl as being 30 inches tall and wearing blue-jean shorts and a multicolored polka dot top. Photos of Emma's smiling face filled Los Angeles television airwaves Thursday morning as investigators conducted a high-profile search for the missing toddler. Sources familiar with the investigation said the mother changed her story by Thursday and was insisting that Emma's death was an accident. Investigators and the county coroner's office must now determine how the girl died. The mother is now helping investigators. \"She is not in custody. She is cooperating with the investigation,\" Nelson said. Barker is \"not considered a suspect\" at this point, he said. \"But that may change\" as the investigation continues, he said. When asked whether there were other persons of interest, Nelson said that investigators were \"working additional leads,\" but \"nobody specific\" was under investigation. Sheriff's investigators late Thursday night confirmed that the body was that of Emma.",

San Fernando City Councilwoman Nury Martinez wins school board seat. The solar energy ballot measure known as Measure B went down to defeat Thursday as Los Angeles election officials finished their count of the remaining 49,000 mail-in, provisional and damaged ballots. Sixteen days after the election, city officials announced that Measure B had fallen short of a majority -- with 50.5% of voters opposing the plan and 49.5% in favor of it. The final count left Measure B trailing by 2,644 votes. The defeat dealt a blow to the hopes of Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who had spent $145,000 from a campaign committee on behalf of the measure and appeared in a blitz of television commercials promoting it. But it also was a setback for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, whose top officials had proposed Measure B. The union's various locals, nationals and affiliated nonprofit groups had spent more than $673,000 toward its passage -- more than half of the total collected by the Measure B campaign. Labor groups provided two-thirds of the campaign's funding. Measure B would have required the city Department of Water and Power to install 400 megawatts of solar panels by 2014. All the work would have been performed by DWP employees represented by the electrical workers union. Backers said it would have reduced the city's reliance on fossil fuels, provided more dependable power and created good jobs. Opponents said it would have hiked electrical rates significantly and locked out construction trade workers In the closely divided race to replace Los Angeles school board member Julie Korenstein, San Fernando City Councilwoman Nury Martinez defeated educator Louis Pugliese, a two-time school board candidate. On election night, Pugliese trailed Martinez by 482 votes.",

    "sentence": "Trucking toward a port-pollution solution. The gig: Founder and chief executive of one of Los Angeles' smallest publicly traded firms. Balqon Corp. is a 12-employee company that recently completed the assembly of the first in a series of heavy-duty electric trucks that will be hauling cargo at the Port of Los Angeles, the nation's busiest container port. The L.A. port has signed on for 25 trucks at a cost of $5.7 million. Samra is hoping to market the technology to railroads and others. Family influence: Samra, 46, who was born near New Delhi, is the first male in his family to choose a civilian career over the military. Samra jokes that his civilian status makes him \"the only wimp in the family,\" but discipline seems to run in his blood. Samra says he barely allowed himself to sleep during college and often works as late as 1 a.m. Background: Samra came to the U.S. in 1980 and went to work on his first day in the country at Micro Peripherals in Chatsworth. Later, as the quality-control manager for a U.S. electronics firm called Flextronics, he held overseas factories to a 100-point efficiency and quality measurement standard, demanding that each subcontractor show improvement in performance annually. He held himself to the same rigid standards when he formed Balqon in 2005. Education: Chemical engineering degree from Panjab University. Samra says he has never used his chemical engineering training and viewed every firm that contracted with his employers as a case study on how to run a business. The problem: Samra's company had the expertise to design its electric vehicle but didn't have the capital or a location suitable for a vehicle assembly line. The breakthrough: In the Port of Los Angeles, Samra found the rough equivalent of a venture capitalist and a technology incubator desperate for answers to Southern California's biggest single source of air pollution. Under an arrangement with the port and the South Coast Air Quality Management District, Balqon got $527,000 in seed money to build and test a prototype. Samra was required to move his company across the county line from Santa Ana to Los Angeles, and he found an office park facility in Harbor City that was large enough to work on several trucks at once. Coming together: The truck chassis arrives pre-assembled, but without an engine or a standard transmission. Power is generated through two trays of seven forklift batteries. Samra doesn't talk about the controller itself or the software that runs it. \"That would be the secret sauce,\" he quips. Hobbies: None. The Laguna Hills resident is so busy with his new truck line that he has time only for work. Bare bones: Walk into the Balqon offices, and no one greets you. The company is hiring engineers first and a receptionist later. Samra's office has that just-moved-in look, even though Balqon relocated seven months ago. A copy of Ayn Rand's \"Atlas Shrugged\" sits untouched on the corner of his desk where a Christmas gift-giver left it. \"Maybe by next Christmas,\" he says.",

    "sentence": "Tour traces L.A.'s spiritual diversity. Subtitled \"L.A.'s Unique Spiritual Legacy,\" the tour featured five venues that contributed to the spiritual traditions of the region. As the main title suggested, it was all about people seeking something beyond themselves. In addition to seeing the fellowship on Mount Washington, people who took the driving tour visited the Chapel of Jesus Ethic in Glendale, the Philosophical Research Society in Los Feliz, the Bonnie Brae House in Historic Filipinotown and one of the most recognizable religious buildings in Los Angeles: the domed Angelus Temple in Echo Park. In a printed guide to the tour, Trudi Sandmeier, director of education for the conservancy, wrote, \"As our 'City of Seekers' tour illustrates, our built environment is rich in historic religious sites, both traditional and nontraditional.\" would fall in the latter category. The organization was founded in 1920 by Paramahansa Yogananda, an Indian swami who introduced America to yoga and gained a worldwide following with his \"Autobiography of a Yogi. It's said that Yogananda had a vision of the Mount Washington site, which offers commanding views of downtown Los Angeles. As docents explained, the Mount Washington Hotel opened there in 1910 and was connected to the flatlands 940 feet below by an incline railway that was dismantled long ago. In 1925 the Mission Revival-style hotel was purchased by Yogananda, who made the site his headquarters. It remains a center for study and meditation. As one of the docents explained, pointing to parts of the complex, \"Nuns to the right; monks to the left.\" The rich and famous were among Yogananda's friends, including conductor Leopold Stokowski and famed horticulturist Luther Burbank. Which brings us to the cactus. As the story goes, Burbank talked lovingly to a cactus, so reassuring and calming that the plant dropped its needles. A cutting from the cactus was planted at the Self-Realization Fellowship and still flourishes, free of spines. Yogananda blended Eastern traditions, such as breath control, with Christianity. Indeed, visitors to the center's library could see another of his many books, \"The Yoga of Jesus,\" whose cover depicts Jesus sitting in a lotus position. To the west, across the street from the Glendale Galleria, the Chapel of Jesus Ethic offered another example of religious synthesis. The building, with a sweeping roof and lots of windows, is an example of the Modern design school popular in the 1960s. A garden is based on a garden found at Yogananda's fellowship. The complex was built as the centerpiece for the (pronounced NISH-ence), which also blends Christianity with Eastern belief systems and practices, such as meditation. Founded by Colton, who died in 1984 two months shy of her 86th birthday, the foundation also places a premium on the creative arts. The conservancy's tour booklet offered this striking anecdote: \"It was while conducting worship services in the Chapel of the Jesus Ethic on Aug. 12, 1973, that Colton experienced what is described by her followers as a levitation miracle. At this moment, as witnessed by those in the congregation, her body rose into the air and turned over, landing on her back a short distance down the aisle from her original position. She explained that this phenomenon was the power of Christ overtaking her body to demonstrate his physical and spiritual power.\" A short drive away was yet another example of how Angelenos have blended traditions and schools of thought. The , near Griffith Park, was the headquarters of Manly P. Hall, who over six decades wrote more than 200 books on philosophy and spiritual practices. His best-known work was the modestly titled \"The Secret Teachings of All Ages: An Encyclopedic Outline of Masonic, Hermetic, Qabbalistic and Rosicrucian Symbolical Philosophy.\" The headquarters is a visual encyclopedia of sorts. It was built in Mayan Revival style, but the carved wooden doors to the library feature Confucius and Plato. Statues are modeled on designs from ancient Egypt. Embedded in the courtyard is a bit of tile from in England, thought by some to be the burial site of King Arthur. The next two sites on the tour reflected sweeping movements of Christianity. The Bonnie Brae House west of downtown is a simple cream-colored wood house surrounded by modest homes and apartments. It may not look like much, but this was where the modern Pentecostal movement was born in 1906. Tradition holds that William J. Seymour and some fellow worshipers there were overtaken by the Holy Spirit and began speaking in tongues. This led to the movement that became known as the could hold 5,300 people when completed in 1923 at the direction of evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson. The building, a blend of vaguely classical columns and arches contrasted with art deco rectangles, looms over Echo Park. Inside visitors gawked at the two balconies and the 30-foot windows designed by \"Sister Aimee.\" By mid-afternoon, a rock band set up in the sanctuary and began to practice -- loudly -- for a service geared toward a young audience. The tour-takers, who were old enough to have annoyed their own parents by cranking up Rolling Stones albums, could not stand the volume for long and left the sanctuary. But, in a sense, the band was just doing what worshipers did there generations ago, though at a lower decibel level. They were seeking something as well. That's what tied Angelus Temple to the other tour venues. Like that cactus at the swami's retreat, many people are looking for a safe place to grow, a place where there's no need for spines.",

The study is being performed in part to assess the effect that recent and future economic expansion will have on the highway and jobs in the Manhattan area through 2030. It is also looking at what those effects will be and where they will occur. Similar studies are being performed in other counties through which US-24 runs, such as Leavenworth and Shawnee. The National Bio- and Agro-defense Facility and the jobs it likely will create in the Manhattan area also was a major factor in the local study. Consultants said they based it in part on communities with similar federal research facilities, such as Fermilab in Kane County, Ill., and NERI in Jefferson County, Colo. A similar meeting was held Wednesday in St. George. A third meeting takes place at 5 this evening at the Wamego Seniors Center.

    "sentence": "Snow, ice blanket Kansas; two dead. KANSAS CITY, Mo. â ” Tens of thousands of Kansas utility customers were without power Saturday and two deaths were reported as an early spring blizzard buried parts of Kansas in snow and ice. A 72-year-old man Hutchinson man was shoveling snow and died of an apparent heart attack Saturday, according to the adjutant general's office. On Friday, a 58-year-old woman was killed in a car accident on icy roadways in Marion County. '' Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims of this storm,'' Gov. Kathleen Sebelius said in a news release. '' Many roads in our state are still treacherous, so please be careful as you travel and take extra precautions when walking or working in the current conditions.'' The storm, which dropped several inches of snow around Riley County Friday night and Saturday, did little damage locally, officials said. '' We haven't had any calls,'' said Emergency Management Director Pat Collins. '' There were no roads closed, we haven't been busy at all.'' Collins said crews were out early to prepare roads around the county. Police officials said there were several non-serious wrecks on Interstate 70, but that drivers stayed indoors for the most part. Westar Energy said about 12,700 customers were without power as of about 8:30 p.m. Saturday. The utility said it had restored power to more than 60,000 customers since the storm began, with some customers experiencing multiple outages. Kansas Electric Cooperatives Inc. said five rural electric cooperatives were reporting outages to a combined 5,000 meters, which can serve multiple homes and businesses. Kansas City Power & Light was reporting 2,300 consumers were in the dark, primarily in Anderson County. Most of the utility problems were in south-central Kansas, where up to an eighth of an inch of ice was causing tree branches to snap and knocking down power lines. Ice accumulations were from a quarter inch to an inch across the Flint Hills and parts of southeast Kansas. Much of the state was dealing with heavy snow and a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain. The National Weather Service said the heaviest snow had fallen in parts of southwest Kansas, including 28 inches in the Pratt area with six-foot snow drifts. '' There's a good swath of our area that's covered with at least a foot of snow,'' said Matt Girard, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Dodge City. Heavy winds accompanying the snow diminished visibility in many communities to almost zero and forced authorities to close several local and state highways. Still, the storm was blamed for numerous accidents. Much of central, eastern and southeastern Kansas were reporting a foot and a half or less of snow but were more concerned about the freezing rain making driving even more challenging. The Kansas Department of Transportation said several highways were closed in southwest Kansas due to poor visibility and blowing snow, including long stretches of such major routes as U.S. 54, 56, 83, 160, 183, 283 and 400. Part of U.S. 83 south out of Garden City was reopened, as was U.S. 50 west of Dodge City. Maj. Gen. Tod Bunting, the adjutant general, said a guard search and rescue team in Pratt County reported rescuing two stranded motorists near Pratt. The adjutant general's office also reported that emergency crews in Hutchinson responded to three partially collapsed building. Partial building collapses also were reported in Harvey, Harper and Kingman counties, but no injuries were reported. The Highway Patrol also sent out a plane Saturday to fly over areas of southwest and south-central Kansas to look for stranded drivers. And National Guard helicopters were assisting with search and rescue efforts. The National Guard also opened armories in Dodge City, Great Bend, Hutchinson, Kingman, Larned, Pratt and West Wichita Saturday as warming stations. Earlier Saturday, Sebelius signed a declaration of disaster emergency for 62 counties, allowing state resources to help local officials.",

The Miami-Dade Fire Rescue firefighter saved both passengers at the Miami Beach Marina on March 31, 2008. On Friday, he received the Silver Medal of Valor. More than 60 firefighters and police received awards for their acts of bravery in 2008, such as saving babies from burning buildings, snatching swimmers from rough seas and pulling people out of wrecked cars. CBS4 anchor Michael Williams presented dozens of awards, including one to firefighter Anthony Oro, who held onto a woman's hand for two hours on May 14 beneath the sweltering sun while fellow firefighters cut away at the car in which she was trapped. Another award was given to firefighter and diver Augustin Hondares, whose Fire Rescue unit responded April 20 when a child's parents were trapped under water in a car. Hondares drove to the canal, so he had no time to put on his scuba gear. He instead held his breath, dove into the cold, murky water and pulled out one passenger. He then dove back in, located the second passenger, and had Lt. Richard Rosell pull the man out. Although both parents later died at the hospital, Hondares, Rosell and others received awards for their heroic efforts. DiGiacomo credited teamwork for helping firefighters save two people from the burning yacht. '' We couldn't fathom not getting them out,'' he said. Those thoughts ``can't even creep in.'' Fire Chief Herminio Lorenzo said the firefighters earned their awards by taking their skills and sense of honor with them to all places, on and off the job. '' The individuals we honor today are those who have gone above and beyond the call of duty . . . who went beyond logic and common sense -- to save somebody,'' he said.",

    "sentence": "Fire near Orlando might shut I-4. Mar. 21 -- The smoke is back -- and with it the need for drivers to check conditions before they hit the road. A rapidly growing brush fire made commuting an ordeal for drivers on Interstate 4 on Friday night and threatens to close the highway today between DeLand and Daytona Beach if winds flare up as expected. '' It's [the weather] so unpredictable, we never know when we're going to have to shut it down,'' said Sgt. Kim Miller, a Florida Highway Patrol spokeswoman. Fifteen brush fires were burning in Volusia County on Friday, and another was under control in Osceola. The largest, spanning 800 acres near State Road 44, was first reported March 6 and was caused by people, according to the U.S. Forestry Service Web site. It doubled in size from Thursday morning to Friday night, said Shelley Szafraniec, a Volusia County spokeswoman. It is in a wooded, swampy area near DeLand difficult for firefighters to reach, she said. The blaze was within an eighth of a mile of I-4, but officials said they didn't plan to close the road unless it burned closer. Motorists were advised to slow down and use their lights if visibility dims. '' People need to use caution in this area,'' Szafraniec said. The flames, fanned by high winds, jumped a line that firefighters plowed. They weren't visible from the road. But smoke could be seen -- and smelled -- as far away as north Seminole County. Eight Florida Highway Patrol troopers were monitoring conditions. If flames burn across the highway, the road would be closed between I-95 and S.R. 472, Miller said. Dry weather is expected to continue until the rainy season starts in mid-May, said Bob Wimmer, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Melbourne. Winds, which are expected to kick up to 20mph this afternoon, won't help. '' Conditions have been dry, and we're getting into the driest part of our year,'' he said. A La Nina weather pattern is partly to blame, said Tony Cristaldi, another weather-service meteorologist. The phenomenon, which shifts Pacific Ocean temperatures and North American wind patterns, usually turns the rain spigot off for Florida during the winter and spring. The system is weakening, but ''the atmosphere doesn't instantaneously react,'' Cristaldi said. ``We're expected to stay dry right through the spring.'' The Florida Division of Forestry is working to control the flames with help from Volusia County firefighters, said Timber Weller of the forestry division. '' Being this dry, and the humidity being low, makes it very difficult to stop a fire,'' he said. ``The conditions are really stacked against them [firefighters] right now.'' Meanwhile, a 300-acre-plus brush fire was contained by Friday night in east Osceola County. The fire is near Crabgrass, Owens and Harris roads east of rural Holopaw, county spokeswoman Niki Whisler said. One or two dozen homes are nearby but are not in immediate danger, she said. '' One problem we have is the wind keeps shifting,'' Whisler said. The fire started Thursday, died down and flared again Friday.",

    "sentence": "Democrats blast Bill McCollum's public service ads. Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum appears in nearly every frame of a 30-second, widely run commercial warning parents and children about sex offenders online. '' This ad needed a message. It needed a messenger,'' he said Thursday. ``It couldn't be just done with words.'' But Gov. Charlie Crist and Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink -- whose public service announcements were nominated for regional Emmy awards last year -- stayed out of the ads. And unlike McCollum, a Republican who hired his 2006 campaign media consultant to produce and air his ad, Crist and Sink sought competitive bids for the ad contracts. '' CFO Sink wanted to make sure Floridians were getting the best deal possible, so she required a competitive bidding process,'' said Kyra Jennings, a spokeswoman for the Democratic officeholder. ``There's also a big distinction from the attorney general's ads in that they feature him so prominently.'' McCollum's $1.4 million media blitz has become a target for the Florida Democratic Party, which says the ads cross the line from public service announcements into political commercials. Party spokesman Eric Jotkoff singled out a $550 expenditure for makeup among the production costs. '' While the attorney general claims that this ad campaign was about promoting public safety, it shouldn't take a $550 makeup job in a vain attempt to make him look good politically,'' he said. McCollum is expected to run for reelection in 2010, though he may run for governor if Crist does not seek another term. Asked about the makeup after he did a cybercrime presentation at Westpine Middle School in Sunrise, McCollum said, ``I didn't know how much the makeup artist costs. It's a package . . . the makeup comes with it.'' In his most extensive comments on the ads since The Miami Herald wrote about them last week, McCollum emphasized that they were bought not with tax dollars, but with money from settlements with companies accused of hiding the costs of cellphone services. The ads run by Crist and Sink were funded with taxpayer money. McCollum said he hired his former campaign consultant, Chris Mottola, because the state's competitive bidding process was ''very slow, very complicated.'' He cited an exemption in state law that allows him to use a no-bid contract for ``artistic services.'' The ad shows McCollum speaking directly to the camera about the dangers of Internet sex predators, with children walking school hallways and using a laptop in the background. '' The development of the ad is artistic. It's how you present it,'' McCollum said. ``You got 30 seconds to be able to tell somebody something.'' The governor's ''Explore Adoption'' campaign last year included five different television videos, including one featuring a boy with his adoptive father at the batting cages. The cost of producing and airing the videos, as well as related radio and billboard ads, was about $650,000. Sink's ''My Safe Florida Homes'' ads, which cost $1.06 million, show consumers on their computers applying for free hurricane inspections. For the attorney general's ads, Philadelphia-based Mottola received 10 percent of the cost of the television time, plus about $38,000 for production, according to McCollum's office. That means he earned about $136,000 on the deal -- more than the $87,511 he was paid by McCollum during the 2006 campaign. '' We felt as a team that we had the very best in the business to make this film at a very good price,'' McCollum said. ```I would expect if we continue to run this ad we would probably use him again to make the buy.'' McCollum has approval from the Florida Legislature to spend another $1.1 million in settlement cash on the cybercrime ad. It is currently airing in South Florida in English and Spanish, where it ran for part of January and all of February. It also ran for six weeks over the summer in Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Pensacola, Panama City and Gainesville. McCollum's office released an e-mail from a mother who said that until she saw the ad, she didn't know where to turn when her daughter received naked pictures on her cellphone. '' The good news is that we've gotten their attention,'' McCollum said. ``I don't care if anyone wants to criticize the ad. It's been effective.''",

    "sentence": "New U.S. Airline Cleared to Fly to Petersburg. Major airlines are slashing prices and grounding planes to remain profitable in the tough global economy. But a group of investors believe that the time is ripe to launch a new airline offering flights between New York and St. Petersburg. Baltia Air Lines has won approval from the U.S. Transportation Department to provide nonstop service between New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and St. Petersburg's Pulkovo 2 Airport, and the flights will start this summer, the airline's chief executive, Igor Dmitrowsky, told The Moscow Times. The airline will initially offer the round-trip flights once a week on a Boeing 747, later expanding to three days per week and then five days per week, Dmitrowsky said. The eight-hour flight will be the first direct connection between St. Petersburg and any city in North America, which Dmitrowsky sees as an unfilled niche that will give the airline an advantage. Dmitrowsky said the economic downturn would also make Baltia competitive. \"Frankly, these are the best of times for us. The fuel price has gone down dramatically, and the other costs are not so extreme,\" Dmitrowsky said by telephone from New York. \"Can you imagine if we were living in an era where Pan Am was flourishing along with other major airlines with no debt?\" he said. \"We would have such a hard time breaking into the market and an even harder time staying afloat.\" Baltia intends to offer three-class service in its aircraft, which will feature a white fuselage with a red tail emblazoned with a white rooster, representing punctuality. The airlines currently offering direct flights to the United States -- Aeroflot, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines -- provide two-class service. A fourth carrier, United Airlines, will start flights to Russia next Sunday after postponing the Washington-Moscow route last year because of high fuel costs. Oil prices have dropped from a high of about $150 last summer to around $50 last week. But the financial crisis has since enveloped the global economy, discouraging business and leisure travel and forcing airlines to cut prices and capacity. Last week, United Airlines slashed prices to mark the start of the new daily flights between Washington's Dulles Airport and Moscow's Domodedovo Airport. Sample fares on the airline's web site show one-way tickets to Moscow via Dulles costing $119 from New York and $167 from Los Angeles. The tickets must be purchased by Thursday, and travel is between March 29 and April 30. Several other airlines dropped their prices below $500 for round-trip flights to Moscow last week, said Rick Seaney, chief executive of FareCompare.com. Seaney linked the price cuts to the crisis. \"You have to understand that this is an absolutely crazy airfare environment,\" he said in a column on the ABC News web site. \"The airlines are trying to fill up their planes, but people are procrastinating -- while others just aren't flying. ... So we get the yo-yo price game: When nobody's buying tickets, prices take a dive.\" He said he found American Airlines offering one round-trip fare of $205 from Baltimore to Moscow. Baltia's ticket costs will remain \"along the lines of the current price structure on carriers with connecting services,\" Dmitrowsky said. But Baltia's web site is already promoting a host of discounts to students, seniors and youth. During the first month of service, all passengers will receive 25 percent off the ticket cost, and the first 300 passengers to book flights will receive a free ticket for future use. The date for Baltia's inaugural flight remains to be set, pending approval of its air certification documents from the Federal Aviation Authority, Dmitrowsky said. He said approval was expected within three months. The airline, based in Rego Park, New York, will start service with a single 747. It hopes to start nonstop flights between New York and Moscow, Kiev, Minsk and Riga next year. Dmitrowsky, a U.S. citizen born in Riga, founded a kefir company in 1979 and led it to a public offering in 1986. He has financed several aircraft and automotive projects, but his dream for nearly 15 years has been to launch Baltia. Baltia's shares, which trade on the \"over-the-counter bulletin board\" electronic system, closed up 20 percent at $0.04 on Friday after seeing a 52-week low of $0.01 on Nov. 12 and a high of $0.07 on March 24. Dmitrowsky faces an uphill battle. Airlines could lose more than $2.5 billion in 2009 after cargo volume dropped by 23 percent and passenger traffic fell by 5.6 percent in January, the International Air Transport Association said last week. Aviation industry insiders questioned the wisdom of United Airlines' plans to fly to Russia when they were announced last year, noting that flights between Moscow and the United States were rarely filled. United Airlines said at the time that planes on the Moscow flights would carry a combination of passengers and freight, making the route profitable. American Airlines started flights to Moscow from its home base in Chicago last year. Delta has been flying between Moscow and two U.S. cities, New York and Atlanta, for years. Electricity suppliers across the country are cracking down as the number of delinquent private and corporate customers surges, as the dilapidated industry is mired in debt linked to unpaid consumer bills and the multibillion-dollar investment programs that investors signed onto during the privatization of Unified Energy System, which wrapped up just weeks before the financial crisis struck.",

    "sentence": "At Least 17 Slain in Dagestani Battle. MAKHACHKALA -- Three days of intense fighting between police and insurgents in a wooded area of Dagestan ended Saturday with five officers and about a dozen militants left dead, officials said. Clashes are frequent in Dagestan, but the fighting in an area near the border with Georgia and Azerbaijan was some of the most intense in recent months. Helicopter gunships fired on the militant positions. Regional Interior Ministry spokesman Mark Tolchinsky said 14 insurgents were killed, but Interfax cited the Federal Security Service as saying 12 died. \"The group committed several crimes in two regions in Dagestan,\" Dagestani Interior Minister Adilgirei Magomedtagirov told reporters. \"There are at least three non-Russians with Arab nationality among the dead militants, perhaps even four,\" he said. State-owned Vesti-24 television showed a row of dead rebels lying in the snow with Kalashnikov rifles slung across their limp shoulders. Magomedtagirov said a collection of Kalashnikov rifles, machine guns and a sniper rifle were found where the militants were hiding. Earlier, television showed helicopter gunships firing from the snowy skies at targets in a forest and armored vehicles rolling into the mountainous area. The police action, which began Wednesday, came after officials in the regions complained to regional authorities about the presence of the gunmen. Underscoring the seriousness of the fighting, state-run television prominently showed a meeting Friday between Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and Dagestan's leader, Mukhu Aliyev. In the Dagestani capital, Makhachkala, police fatally shot four men Friday who failed to stop their car at a checkpoint and began shooting at officers, city police spokesman Shamil Guseinov said. The bodies of the four were shown on television lying among shattered glass near a battered, white Lada car. Dagestan's militants are seen as having been inspired by separatists in neighboring Chechnya. The fighting is the latest round of violence to plague the North Caucasus, pitting criminal gangs, Islamic militants or feuding clans against one another or against government and police forces. A three-hour shootout Thursday north of the capital of Kabardino-Balkaria left four gunmen killed. Electricity suppliers across the country are cracking down as the number of delinquent private and corporate customers surges, as the dilapidated industry is mired in debt linked to unpaid consumer bills and the multibillion-dollar investment programs that investors signed onto during the privatization of Unified Energy System, which wrapped up just weeks before the financial crisis struck.",

    "sentence": "Murmansk's Governor Resigns. Murmansk Governor Yury Yevdokimov resigned abruptly Saturday after enduring a week of harsh criticism from United Russia over the loss of the Murmansk mayoral election to an independent candidate. President Dmitry Medvedev welcomed Yevdokimov's resignation and appointed Federal Fisheries Agency deputy head Dmitry Dmitriyenko as the acting governor, the Kremlin said. Political analysts said it was the first instance that a regional leader had been forced out of office for supporting a non-United Russia candidate in an election. Independent candidate Sergei Subbotin, a former Murmansk deputy governor, was elected mayor with 61 percent of the vote in a runoff election on March 15, well over the 35 percent collected by the United Russia candidate, incumbent Mayor Mikhail Savchenko. After the election, the new mayor refused to join United Russia but declared himself a supporter of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who heads United Russia. Yevdokimov, a United Russia member, had served as Murmansk governor since 1996 and was appointed by then-President Putin to a fourth term in 2007. In an interview with Gazeta. ru on Thursday, he denied speculation that he would step down. But on Saturday, he said he thought that it would be best for the country if he quit. \"I've always been ready to bear responsibility for my actions,\" he said, Interfax reported. Senior United Russia officials had accused him of violating election law by offering support for the non-United Russia candidate on local television and threatened to throw him out of the party. United Russia said in a weekend statement on its web site that Yevdokimov had resigned on his own accord. The acting governor, Dmitriyenko, 46, served in submarine units of the Navy from 1980 to 1992 and was appointed as deputy head of the Federal Fisheries Agency last year. United Russia welcomed Dmtiriyenko's appointment. \"There is a need for professionals able to work in new ways during crisis conditions,\" party official Sergei Neverov said in the web site statement. Dmitriyenko will be sworn in as governor on Wednesday, pending confirmation by the regional legislature, which is controlled by United Russia. Dmitriyenko flew to Murmansk on Saturday to meet with regional United Russia officials. In his first official statement as acting governor, Dmitriyenko said he would focus on ways to make regional spending more effective. Alexei Titkov, regions analyst at the Institute of Regional Politics, said the shuffle was the first time that a governor has been replaced after a conflict with United Russia over support of a candidate in elections. \"Yevdokimov's resignation will become an example for the other governors,\" Titkov said. The resignation follows a series of replacements started when Medvedev dismissed four governors in February. The president has the right to appoint and dismiss governors under a law proposed by Putin in 2004. Meanwhile, the State Duma on Friday approved in a final third reading a bill that would give the party that holds the most seats in a regional legislature the right to propose gubernatorial candidates. Under the existing procedure, this right belongs to the presidential envoys to the federal districts. The bill, which now must be approved by the Federation Council and then the president, says the party should propose at least three candidates to the president no later than 90 days before the incumbent governor's term expires. If the president doesn't select anyone from this group within a month, the party must propose three more candidates. If the party doesn't do this, the president can select the candidate himself. Also, the president is not obliged to select a candidate from those proposed by the party. The bill was sent to the Duma in December by Medvedev. United Russia controls nearly all the regional legislatures in Russia. Electricity suppliers across the country are cracking down as the number of delinquent private and corporate customers surges, as the dilapidated industry is mired in debt linked to unpaid consumer bills and the multibillion-dollar investment programs that investors signed onto during the privatization of Unified Energy System, which wrapped up just weeks before the financial crisis struck.",

TBILISI, Georgia -- Georgian police in arrested several opposition members on arms charges on Monday, in what their party leader said was a \"campaign of terror\" ahead of anti-government rallies next month. The opposition has stepped up pressure on President Mikheil Saakashvili since Georgia's disastrous defeat by Russia in a five-day war last August and plans a series of protests beginning on April 9 to demand his resignation. The Interior Ministry said 10 people had been arrested on charges of purchasing automatic weapons, including some \"not very high-ranking\" members of the Democratic Movement-United Georgia party led by former Saakashvili ally Nino Burjanadze. Ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili said police were not specifically linking the arrests to the planned protests. \"We don't claim this to be a political conspiracy,\" he said. \"The only thing we know is that there are people who have expressed interest in buying weapons and have bought weapons. \"This [the police operation] is aimed at preventing any possible violence in the future and to make sure the political processes don't get interrupted by violence that might come from a thousand different sources. \"Police showed journalists about 20 minutes of secretly filmed video of what it said were the suspects buying weapons, which included automatic rifles. Burjanadze said the detained included the party's regional head in the coastal region of Ajara and her husband's driver. \"The authorities have begun a campaign of terror in the country,\" she said. \"This government has little time to rule, so stay calm and don't be provoked.\" Electricity suppliers across the country are cracking down as the number of delinquent private and corporate customers surges, as the dilapidated industry is mired in debt linked to unpaid consumer bills and the multibillion-dollar investment programs that investors signed onto during the privatization of Unified Energy System, which wrapped up just weeks before the financial crisis struck.",

    "sentence": "Olympic Problems in Sochi. According to the statements of the Olympic organizers, Russia is not going to abandon its initial plans and obligations related to the Winter Olympic Games 2014 organization in Sochi. The budgets of the Olympic projects, financed either by the state or private investors, are subjected to the review only in connection with the construction budget reduction. But the most burning issue is related to the land plot allocation of the Olympic facilities. It is worth noting that according to the law, the Program for Sochi Development and Olympic Facilities Construction and the data of the organization that carries out the Olympic facilities area planning scheme design and approval (Giprogor Federal State Unitary Enterprise), there is an already determined plot allocation for the Olympic facilities and other building with serve a function to the Olympic facilities. The land plots within the boundaries stated in the approved construction plan, are subject to withdrawal for public needs on the basis of the resolution of the Governor of Krasnodar. The land plots, as well as objects located there, are bought from the private owners on the basis of a market value appraisal report. After the IOC Valuation Committee visit to Sochi in February 2007, the authorities promised to buy land plots from inhabitants of Nizhne-Imeritinskaya Bay, whose land plots were predominantly those subject to withdrawal at the market value, but a year and a half later no land plots purchase agreements had been supplied to their owners. Although according to the laws there is a 20-day window for drafting a purchase agreement upon receipt of an appraiser's report. The department responsible for organizing the Olympic Games in the Krasnodar area responds to the official inquiries that the delays in the statutory period for drafting purchase agreements is caused by the need to update appraisal reports on the market value of the objects to be bought. It should be noted that the process of land plot title registration in Sochi is particularly inefficient in terms of time and money. For this reason many inhabitants of Nizhne-Imeritinskaya Bay haven't yet registered their land title in a proper way, or they are still in the process of registering their land title. In this case, there is no talk of market value or even of reasonable compensation; there is social tension, which has lead to numerous protests. Litigations on invalidating the resolution of the Governor of the Krasnodar area concerning land plots withdrawal haven't been realized, as a great number of legislative innovations, meant for simplifying the Olympic construction process, give opportunities for administrative discretion, when applied, but, unfortunately, at the same time they do not supply any protection of the titleholders' rights. And the judges have demonstrated their position clearly -- if a decree violates an applicant's legal rights or interests, but it formally complies with the law, there are no grounds for its invalidation. If the Olympic object arrangement only affects some insignificant part of the land plot, it is reasonable not to withdraw it in full, but to introduce a paid fixed easement, for example, i.e. a restricted right to use the land plot for public needs. Such an easement introducing procedure is organizationally simpler, and requires minimum of budget assets. In terms of the financial crisis, all the executors of the Olympic project continue to emphasize the need for costs optimization and more efficient use of the existing opportunities. Financing difficulties, significant reduction of credit assets leads to an inevitable decrease in investors, who undertake truly \"Olympic\" obligations. And the state suggests to the existing investors that construction volumes should be correspondingly increased. Thus, the Turkish company Kolin, which won the tender for constructing the sea port cargo zone, will have to equip yachting in the harbor waters now. Electricity suppliers across the country are cracking down as the number of delinquent private and corporate customers surges, as the dilapidated industry is mired in debt linked to unpaid consumer bills and the multibillion-dollar investment programs that investors signed onto during the privatization of Unified Energy System, which wrapped up just weeks before the financial crisis struck.",

    "sentence": "Cipolli, New London on the record. Ever since New London Police Chief Tom Cipolli made a public appeal to keep his job, New Londoners have been asking why Mayor Mike McBeth has been seeking to remove him. The mayor had planned to lay out his case at a public hearing on Tuesday, more than three months after the issue became public; but a 3-2 vote by the city council delayed that hearing until April, visibly frustrating McBeth and many of the 60 residents who turned out in search of answers. Neither McBeth nor Cipolli has publicly addressed the specific complaints behind McBeth’s request to dismiss the chief. But the Mt. Pleasant News has reviewed legal documents filed as evidence in the matter, and Cipolli’s formal response, which provide the clearest and most comprehensive look so far at the dispute between the two men. The files that accompany McBeth’s request cite 21 different reasons that McBeth was to cite in support of the action – alleging improper conduct, poor management of the police force, insubordination, untruthful statements to police and city officials and general incompetence. Cipolli, who has called McBeth's accusations \"false and misleading,\" offers a broad response, including a look back at his nearly two years leading the New London Police Department, while responding to several of the claims made in McBeth's case. \"I strongly believe that I have changed the department for the better,\" Cipolli writes, asserting that crime in New London has fallen during his tenure, to which he credited better training and improved professionalism within the department and stronger relationships with the community. \"These positive relationships continue today,\" he writes, \"as do my efforts to insure New London is a safe community. \"The 119-page request includes seven affidavits, two from New London police officers, four from area residents and one from Winfield police chief John Chaney. At the end is a seven-page response from Cipolli. The full text of Cipolli's reponse, as well as each of the affidavits, can be read by following the links in this article. In addition, the files include e-mails from Cipolli, a section of the New London Code of Ordinances, Police Bill of Rights and police department manual, police expense reports and newspaper articles written on the matter. These are not included, but may be viewed, along with all other public documents, at the New London City Office, 112 W. Main St.",

Vicki Lensing, D-Iowa City. “Over the past 30 years, bureaucracy at every level of government failed these men,” said Culver. “We have a chance to rectify past mistakes by making the changes to our laws necessary to protect our most vulnerable Iowans and punish those who abuse them.” The task force was formed following allegations about the treatment and living conditions of men at Henry’s Turkey Service, a Texas-based company operating a bunkhouse in Atalissa.",

Announcing the result at the county supervisors’ meeting this morning, County Engineer Bill Belzer said the final award would be about $35,900, plus an unknown amount of interest. It was a considerably smaller amount than the county had hoped for. “I didn’t think we’d get less than $50,000,” Belzer said, “considering the fact that Washington County had a smaller bridge that they got more money for.”",

Engineering Consultant Ray Flemons reviewed the status of draft reports on regional water supply planning for the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) Regional Water Plan to be completed in 2011. There was considerable discussion on the population projections. Flemons said that, while the TWDB at this date would not allow any change in the population figures for each county, his firm recommended changing the estimates within counties. He said the Texas State Demographer feels population is shifting from rural areas into cities above the 5,000 level. Board members decided that, rather than change the methodology of making population estimates, they would stay with the current figures until revised by the 2010 federal census. Another report being prepared is on the utilization of the region's brackish water, reported Flemons. The draft reports will be ready by mid-May, he said, in time for board members to read them before the next meeting. The board also heard a presentation from the City of Canton, which is planning to build a new city reservoir to meet it projected population needs. The city's representatives asked that their water system expansion be incorporated into the regional water plan. The next planning group meeting will be May 27, at 1 p.m., at the Mount Pleasant Civic Center.",

Deputies and officers from both departments converged on the scene and searched the area for Hellinghausen. As the search continued, MPPD officers located Hellinghausen in a nearby trash dumpster. As the deputies and officers spoke with the suspect, it was determined that Hellinghausen had ingested an unknown amount of methamphetamine before he bailed out of his vehicle. Hellinghausen was then transported to Titus Regional Medical Center to be treated. Hellinghausen was booked into the Titus County Jail where he was charged with a state jail felony charge of evading detention with a vehicle; a second state jail felony charge of possession of a controlled substance, penalty group one, under one gram; and a third degree felony charge of tampering with physical evidence.",

    "sentence": "Health is more than skin deep, says Dr. Greco. \"Dermatology is a wide-ranging specialty,\" according to Dr. Anthony Greco. \"It encompasses the spectrum of medical conditions. \"That explains why his practice n The Medical and Surgical Dermatology Center of Northeast Texas n is so busy, and also why he finds it so interesting. \"You learn something new every day. \"Dr. Greco has become a fixture in the Mount Pleasant medical community since coming here to practice in 1997, but his roots extend all the way to Canada - Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, to be exact, where he grew up. His mother's family was from Michigan, but he had an uncle who lived in Houston, and when he was young, he would him. Like so many transplants, his move to Texas was later partially motivated by the weather. \"I got tired of Canadian winters,\" he laughs. \"I liked the good climate like we have in Texas.\" He said he knew he wanted to be a physician from an early age. \"I was fascinated by medicine, I always knew I wanted to go into medicine. \"After he received his degree in internal medicine from the University of Toronto in 1992, he spent three years at McGill University in Montreal doing his dermatological residencyHe said he was proud to be accepted to study dermatology at McGill, one of the most prestigious universities in Canada. \"It's top notch and very competitive, it's very hard to get in there. \"Of all the sub-specialties in medicine, dermatology is one of the broadest because there are so many medical conditions that can manifest symptoms on the surface. A dermatologist needs to be familiar with at least 2,000 different conditions that might show signs or symptoms on or through the skin. \"You have to know a lot of internal medicine,\" he explains. He said he realized as soon as he started practicing in Mount Pleasant there was a great need to be served. People were traveling to Sulphur Springs, Greenville and as far as Dallas for their dermatological care. \"I've been super busy,\" he said, but he gets a lot of satisfaction from his work. The nature of dermatology is that his work usually shows results immediately, and patients are appreciative of that. \"You usually don't see chronic of end-stage illnesses,\" he said. \"You usually see results right away. \"Of course, skin cancer is one of the most common diseases he treats. It's not necessarily because of the blistering Texas sun, he notes. \"It's because there's a lot of fair-skinned people in Texas. \"He likes to keep up-to-date with the latest treatments, and he's proud to use the Mohs' surgery technique for skin cancer. Mohs surgery is microscopically controlled surgery that is highly effective for common types of skin cancer, with a cure rate cited by most studies between 97% and 99.8%. The Mohs procedure provides precise removal of the cancerous tissue, while healthy tissue is spared. It is essentially a pathology sectioning method that allows for the complete examination of the cancerous area. Dr. Greco says he is very satisfied with how well the Mohs' procedure cuts down on the skin cancer recurrence rate. Like all dermatologists, he says we should all protect ourselves from the sun. Every blistering sunburn causes permanent damage to skin cells, and constant exposure will make you age so much faster, he notes. Another problem he says is common, at least in this area, are tick bites. \"You'd be amazed, I've seen three people already this week with tick bites,\" he said. Tick bites can be potentially serious because ticks transmit Lyme Disease. He said he usually automatically starts tick bit victims on antibiotics. He urges people to do self-examinations and regular checkups of areas of potential concern, such as moles.",

    "sentence": "Police: Gunman's estranged wife worked at home. CARTHAGE, N.C. (AP) - Investigators are looking into whether a gunman accused of killing eight people in a North Carolina nursing home may have targeted the facility because his estranged wife worked there, police said Monday. Carthage Police Chief Chris McKenzie said the woman, who he did not name, worked at the nursing home. He said he believed that the couple were recently separated but that he did not have any other details. He was not sure if the woman was at the nursing home at the time of the shootings. Authorities said Robert Stewart, 45, went on a terrifying rampage in the Pinelake Health and Rehab center on Sunday morning, killing seven residents and a nurse and wounding three others. \"We're certainly looking into the fact that it may be domestic-related,\" McKenzie told The Associated Press ahead of a Monday morning news conference in this small town about 60 miles southwest of Raleigh in North Carolina's Sandhills region. An ex-wife of Stewart's, Sue Griffin, told reporters Sunday she had not had contact with him since they divorced in 2001 but that he had \"violent tendencies\". Griffin added she didn't know how her ex-husband was connected to the nursing home or why he would shoot people there. The injured included a police officer hailed as a hero for stopping the gunman by shooting and wounding him before more people could be killed. Officials said the shooting could have been bloodier if 25-year-old Carthage Police Officer Justin Garner hadn't wounded Stewart while trading gunfire in a hallway. Garner was wounded in the leg. \"He acted in nothing short of a heroic way today, and but for his actions, we certainly could have had a worse tragedy,\" said Moore County District Attorney Maureen Krueger. \"We had an officer, a well-trained officer, who performed his job the way he was supposed to and prevented this from getting even worse than it is now. \"Griffin, Stewart's ex-wife, said Stewart had been recently reaching out to family members, telling them he had cancer and was preparing for a long trip and to \"go away.\" Krueger said the victims were Pinelake residents Tessie Garner, 88; Lillian Dunn, 89; Jessie Musser, 88; Bessie Hendrick, 78; John Goldston, 78; Margaret Johnson, 89; Louise Decker, 98; and nurse Jerry Avent, whose age wasn't immediately available. Beverly McNeill said her mother, Pinelake resident Ellery Chisholm, called moments after the gunman stormed into her room and pointed his \"deer gun\" at her roommate. \"They're up here shooting, they're up here shooting,\" Chisholm frantically told her 14-year-old granddaughter, Tavia, over the phone, McNeil said. Chisholm told her daughter that she hid her face in her shirt so she couldn't see the man or what she expected him to do, McNeill said. He didn't shoot, but left the room and began shooting down the hallway. The facility was closed after the attack as authorities worked to gather evidence inside and out. Krueger declined to say if authorities had moved the surviving residents from the 110-bed facility, including patients with Alzheimer's disease, saying only, \"They're safe, which is the primary thing. \"Among the items investigators found was a camouflaged-colored rifle or shotgun, which was leaning against the side of a Jeep Cherokee in the parking lot. Sunday's rampage happened just weeks after a man killed 10 people, including his mother and several other relatives, in the worst mass shooting in Alabama's history on March 10. On March 11, a teen killed 12 people at his former high school in Germany.",

    "sentence": "Putting children on witness stand wrenching for all. BY RUSS ZIMMER Advocate Reporter March 15, 2009 NEWARK -- Unfortunately, it's not an unusual sight -- a child walking toward the witness stand, usually with something in his or her grip, like a stuffed animal or an adult's hand. The child climbs up into the chair, feet not even touching the floor, preparing to talk about something of a very adult nature. Six minors took the stand in their capacity as alleged victims in rape trials in 2007 and 2008, according to data gathered by The Advocate. Many more testified against defendants facing lesser offenses or were interviewed by medical professionals and law enforcement for those cases. Over the past month, juries acquitted two men accused of sexual conduct with a child younger than 13. Doubt was cast on the strength of the state's cases, including inconsistencies in the victims' testimony compared to previous statements and the investigators' methods. Children in each case were required to divulge the alleged conduct, answer legally necessary questions and be subject to cross-examination, all in front of strangers and in front of the defendant. Licking County Prosecutor Ken Oswalt said the convergence of all these elements make an adult victim nervous, let alone a child. These factors can make their testimony unpredictable and sometimes damaging to a case, he said. For those reasons, Oswalt said his office wants to avoid putting children who already have suffered a life-changing experience in that situation. \"We're not in the business of trying to further traumatize kids. ... We're in the business of trying to get people held accountable for the things they do,\" he said. After a child initially discloses abuse and it is reported to authorities, the child usually is taken to Kids' Place, which is a division of Licking Memorial Hospital. There, he or she will receive a physical exam much like any other trip to the doctor's office, but the child will be engaged in a conversation about the allegations, according to testimony in both trials. Newark police Detective Robert Huffman, who has been handling sexual offense investigations for 17 years, said the age of the child greatly affects the wording of the questions. \"The younger the child is, the more steps you have to take to guard against leading the child in any way,\" he said. \"What I try to do is let the child tell me what they want to tell me, really nothing more than that.\" Oswalt said his office tries to limit the number of interviews conducted and officials involved to minimize the embarrassment a child might feel. From Day 1, victims are offered aid through Licking County Victims' Services, which includes trial preparation, Victims' Services Director Mark Weiner said. He said his office tries to educate children about what to expect so they don't feel overwhelmed when they are called to testify. Sometimes they wonder why they have to talk to a room full of people, Weiner said. \"We tell them sometimes bad things happen and you got to go up there and tell the judge,\" he said. The relative tranquility of the witness waiting room alters the second the doors to the courtroom swing open and 14 jurors, attorneys, the judge, the court reporter and observers all are watching as the children make their way to the witness stand. Another set of eyes, the defendant's, also are fixed upon the accuser. Much of the possible inconsistencies in a child's statement might arise from this pressure, Oswalt said. Keep in mind the vast majority of these children are victimized by close relations, he added. \"That puts a young child in a situation of having competing interests or feelings -- maybe one of those is guilt,\" Oswalt said. \"It's a huge dynamic.\" Most of the discrepancies in a child's story heard in court are inconsequential to the question of guilt or innocence, he said. Children might not even consider details of the event important to an adult to be memorable, Oswalt added. \"Daddy touched me and it was yucky,\" he said referring to a typical reaction by an abused child. Huffman said he looks for authenticity in a child's statement in a number of ways, including having knowledge beyond their age. What authorities are listening for are \"things from the child that they should have no knowledge of because of their age. Those are red flags,\" Oswalt said. Consistency also can be checked by reviewing the story with the child and inserting something they didn't say to see if the child corrects them, Huffman said. Defense attorney Kristin Burkett, who represented the exonerated defendants in both unsuccessful prosecutions, grilled police on the lack of an accompanying video or audio tape with their interview notes. Time and again, she asked detectives and jurors how anyone could critique whether the interviews were conducted properly or if stark differences existed in the victim's account if there was no digital or analog record. One juror, who spoke to The Advocate after finding a defendant not guilty, said the lack of a recording and the definitive proof it would have contained influenced his decision. Burkett called it a \"huge problem\" Wednesday in an interview with The Advocate. \"I haven't spoke to an expert that doesn't believe those interviews should be taped,\" she said. \"If they are doing their job properly, there is no reason why they wouldn't want to tape it.\" Huffman said he personally favors taping, but the county has a policy against recording victim statements in child sexual abuse cases. Oswalt said what happens before and after the tape is switched off still will be open to scrutiny by defense attorneys. He added it was \"dead wrong\" to assume a recording would eliminate that same line of questioning. \"At the end of the day, you still need to trust the experience and integrity of the social workers and officers doing the case,\" Oswalt said. Burkett agreed with Oswalt that making a child testify in court is not the ideal outcome for the child. As a defense attorney, Burkett has to find a balance of aggressiveness and tact when questioning young witnesses. She said it's not like questioning an adult witness for the state. \"I don't want to do anything I don't have to when a child is on the stand, but I still have to represent my client,\" she said. Burkett described Licking County as generally a \"non-plea-bargaining jurisdiction\" but said these type of cases are the exception. Judges are more amenable to a reduced charge or disclosing their sentence in order to facilitate a plea, she said. There's little debate about the social stigma attached to sex offenses committed against children, and Burkett said even a not-guilty finding can't erase public perception of a defendant. \"People's lives are changed by the mere allegation of child sex abuse, and it doesn't go away,\" she said, \"which is why I believe these cases should be investigated more thoroughly than any other case.\" The children, win or lose in court, can bounce back with a strong support system, Weiner said. \"Kids are resilient, and with love and support they make it,\" he said.",

    "sentence": "Pataskala zoning allows fire-gutted block to be redeveloped. BY CHAD KLIMACK Advocate Reporter March 29, 2009 PATASKALA -- City officials say it might not be that difficult to redevelop a burned-out block downtown. Some officials initially thought it would take a zoning variance to rebuild two gutted buildings, but that might not be the case. \"It would appear somebody will be able to build a pretty substantial building there without going through a variance at all,\" said Diane Harris, the city's planning and zoning director. A March 7 fire, which investigators have labeled an arson, gutted most of a block on the west side of South Main Street, just south of the railroad tracks. Demolition crews subsequently tore down both 341 and 345 S. Main St. One of the buildings contained a heating and cooling businesses and the other was vacant. Mayor Steve Butcher initially thought the city's zoning would make it difficult for the current property owners -- or future ones -- to rebuild. However, he said that does not appear to be the case because the city's Downtown Business zoning designation permits developers to build something similar to what once stood there. In fact, the zoning would permit one of the property owners to build a three-story building containing up to 24,750 square feet. It would allow the other one to build a three-story building with up to 3,000 square feet. One of the property owners, Fred Ashbaugh, has said he intends to take his time in deciding whether to rebuild. He said he needs to take into account the lack of parking downtown and modern safety codes, in addition to the city's zoning. The other property owner, Claude Williams, could not be reached for comment. City officials have spoken to both property owners, and Butcher said Williams might not want to rebuild. \"We don't have any knowledge Mr. Williams is looking to develop his property, but we sure hope someone is,\" Butcher said. Harris, meanwhile, said the city would be willing to help someone find grants to rebuild. \"From my own perspective, I would like to see something that is respectful of the past,\" said Harris, adding she also would like to see someone build something that meshes with the rest of downtown. Butcher, meanwhile, said he would not be surprised if it takes both property owners time to decide how to proceed. A fire gutted he and his wife Nancy's restaurant, Nutcracker Family Restaurant, in 2005, and although the couple decided to reopen, the decision was not easy, he said. \"We went through the same struggle,\" Butcher said. \"Do we rebuild or do we take the (insurance) money?\"",

    "sentence": "Doctor returns to Newark after practicing in New Zealand. BY ABBEY ROY Advocate Reporter March 30, 2009 NEWARK -- After spending a year on the other side of the equator, practicing at a rural New Zealand hospital with a total of nine beds, Jackie Underwood is thrilled to return home to Licking Memorial Hospital. \"It makes you appreciate here,\" Underwood said. \"It makes you appreciate the United States' private medicine.\" Underwood, a family practitioner at Licking Memorial from 1982-2006 and afterward in New Hampshire and Minnesota, left in January 2007 to practice in New Zealand after researching a brochure she'd received in the mail about the country. The experience was one she is grateful for, and she hopes to return to New Zealand as a tourist someday to explore the parts of it she missed this time around. Still, certain things New Zealand's culture took some getting used to, she said -- primarily, the country's national health care system. \"People have to wait a long time for things,\" Underwood said, citing examples such as tests or referrals. \"Things we take for granted here aren't taken for granted there.\" In New Zealand, she was one of six \"GPs\" -- general practitioners -- at the Queen Street Practice. The people in the town where she worked, Wairoa, were very friendly and mostly Maori, an indigenous group similar in culture, history and language to American Indians, Underwood said. Although the town was \"very blue-collar,\" she said, the citizens were kind and appreciated the care they received -- even if it was just a bit at a time. \"With the national health care ... people came in for one problem and one problem only,\" Underwood said. Additional maladies were required to be scheduled for different appointments. Although she had only 10 vacation days during her time in New Zealand, Underwood was able to accomplish a goal she had set for herself: scuba diving off the coast. When she returns as a tourist, she also hopes to tour the northernmost point of the country's North Island and the southernmost point of South Island, she said. In the meantime, she's content to be back at Licking Memorial, practicing with her old partner and enjoying facilities she said are better than any she's worked at. \"We have really good quality here,\" she said. \"There's a big focus here on quality.\"",

    "sentence": "Houses not selling despite low prices. BY KENT MALLETT Advocate Reporter March 30, 2009 NEWARK -- The recent reported surge in home sales nationally has not yet reached Licking County, according to Licking County property transfer records provided by the county. The number of sales through March 15 dropped from 493 in 2008 to 309 this year, a 37 percent decline. The average sale price fell from $122,492 in 2008 to $110,416 so far in 2009, an almost 10 percent decrease. Jackie Lewis, president of the Licking County Board of Realtors, said she has seen signs better times are ahead, but buyers remain cautious. \"I can truly say people are out looking, but they're still hesitant to make up their minds because so many homes are sitting bank-owned,\" Lewis said. \"In warmer weather, people start to look.\" The National Association of Realtors reported sales of existing homes increased 5.1 percent in February compared to January, the largest monthly sales jump since July 2003. But local sales were virtually unchanged from January to February, according to the local board of Realtors. In the three Licking County cities of Newark, Heath and Pataskala, the sales through March 15 dropped from a combined 251 last year to 155 this year, a 38 percent tumble. Lewis predicts a surge not only because residents traditionally look more seriously in the spring, but also because of investors facing a tax deadline. They want to buy, Lewis said, because they have money they don't want taxed. The Licking County Board of Realtors reports home sales through its Multiple Listing Service fell during the first two months of the year, from 151 in 2008 to 114 this year, a 25 percent decline. Prices also dropped by 11 percent. Still, she thinks the deals are just too good for people to pass up much longer, and the increased sales elsewhere will begin to show up here. \"We see this in anything,\" Lewis said. \"It always hits the West Coast first and comes our way. Why? I have no idea. It's all about educating our buyers.\" Nathan Gill, a mortgage banker with American Eagle Mortgage Corp., said he has fielded an increase in phone calls requesting loan applications, mostly from first-time homebuyers. The reason for the increased interest, he said, probably is the federal tax credit available through Nov. 30. The refundable tax credit, on 2009 taxes filed in 2010, is for 10 percent of the sale price up to $8,000. \"I think the word is finally getting out,\" Gill said. \"We're trying to let people know there are advantages to purchasing homes right now. \"The tax credit, I believe, will have an effect this year. People have got to take advantage of it now.\" The Ohio Housing Finance Agency's Homebuyer Tax Credit Advantage Program, which starts March 30, allows homebuyers to use up to 3 percent of the purchase price for the down payment. They don't have to pay the loan back until July 1, 2010, he said Interest rates, Gill said, were available Friday at about 4.75 percent, compared to 8 percent in 2000, when homes were selling in large numbers.",

    "sentence": "Valley students trace their family genealogy. BY L.B. WHYDE Advocate Reporter March 30, 2009 HANOVER -- The Licking Valley students in library media specialist Tracy Boehmer's E-Research class sat around the table with laptops and a volunteer from the Licking County Genealogy Society by their side. The room was hushed as eyes scanned the countless screens of information the students were scouring to find out more about their own family histories. Suddenly, there was a shout of success as Blake Holdsworth, 18, and her volunteer helper, Terry Cooperrider, discovered Holdsworth's many times-great-uncle with documents from 1355. Holdsworth was told by her grandfather, who is a poet, that she is related to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, a popular American poet of the 19th century, whose famous phrases include \"ships that pass in the night\" and \"the patter of little feet.\" But this discovery confirmed she is related to the poet. \"I think it's really neat,\" Holdsworth said. \"I wanted to know exactly how I was related to him.\" The project is a collaboration between Boehmer and Raynola St. Clair, of the Licking County Genealogy Society. St. Clair wants to get the word out about the importance of knowing family history and the ways to research. The daylong session was open to all students interested in learning more about their ancestors. \"It's important to know how to research on line and what resources are available,\" Boehmer said. \"I am finding a lot is available from the Licking County Public Library. The LC Genealogical Society volunteers couldn't be more helpful.\" Lindsey Evans, 17, a senior, was digging into her family history and found documentation from a ship's passenger list that an ancestor came to this country from Germany in 1852. Senior Carrie Lough, 18, was working with St. Clair and trying to locate her great-great grandfather. Her father had just told her about him, saying he had fought in World War I. It wasn't long before St. Clair could verify that Hugh Jacobson did indeed fight in the war. \"It's really interesting. I never thought about genealogy before,\" Lough said. St. Clair is on a mission to spread the word about importance of family genealogy by giving seminars in the school, churches and one-on-one. Licking Valley High School is conducting another session next year. \"I especially want to get kids involved because they are the ones that will carry this on,\" St. Clair said. Terry Cooperrider, with the Licking County Genealogy Society, talks to Licking Valley senior Blake Holdsworth as they work on tracking Holdworth's family history online.

On March 4, Officer Michael Trotter, one of the two members of the traffic unit, responded to the 500 block of Kelley Lane in reference to assisting Newark Fire with a man who had suffered injuries from a crash. Subsequent investigation revealed that the man had been operating the motorized barstool on Kelley Lane when he crashed it while trying to make a turn, the report states. The man claimed the barstool could reach speeds of 38 mph on its five-horsepower engine but that he was traveling at about 20 mph when he crashed it at 5:40 p.m., according to Trotter’s report. He allegedly admitted to drinking about 15 beers during an interview with Trotter at the hospital, where he was transported after the crash. He was issued a citation for operating a vehicle while intoxicated and driving under suspension, according to court documents. The driver was arraigned last week and pleaded not guilty. He has demanded a jury trial. Newark police says operating any type of machinery after consuming alcohol often has devastating consequences.

    "sentence": "Family takes bait, opens fishing shop. By KENT MALLETT Advocate Reporter March 30, 2009 NEWARK  Wess Henry, who lost his home to foreclosure last year, was fishing for a way to change his luck. He hopes his fortunes change after he opened Drowned Worm Bait Shop on Friday the 13th of March. Henry and his son, Matt, are co-owners of the business at 197 N. Cedar St.Henry purchased the inventory of Newark Live Bait, which closed its Western Avenue business in January. He then found the rent at the Cedar Street location was affordable. The unlikely chain of events started when Matt Henry started planning for a fishing trip a few months ago. “I called down there (to Newark Live Bait) to see what they wanted for bait and she said, I’ll give you what I got because I’m going out of business,’” Matt Henry said. “And, she gave me a price for everything in the store. It was an offer we couldn’t refuse.” The Henrys had talked about opening a bait shop, but the did not know that Newark Live Bait was going out of business until his son stumbled onto the news. “I’d say it was fisherman’s luck,” Wess Henry said. “Everything seemed to fall into place, If (Matt) hadn’t decided to go fishing, it probably wouldn’t be reality. I still can’t believe I’m here.” Wess Henry, 47, a 14-year employee of Tectum Inc., had just enough savings to start the business without a loan, which he said he probably could not have secured anyway. The Henrys said they have a good chance of developing a successful business once people discover them and their location because there is not much competition. “The fishermen are spreading the word amongst themselves,” Wess Henry said. “Everyone is so glad we’re here because there’s nowhere else to get bait. “I’m just trying to listen to what customers want. If people want something, I’ll try to get it in within a week from the bait dealer.” Wess Henry does have some retail experience. His parents had operated what Wess said was the largest bicycle shop in Licking County in the 1980s, Mound City Bicycle Shop on Idlewilde Avenue. The shop will continue the tradition from Newark Live Bait of providing fishing contests and offering a raffle and door prizes. Wess Henry also dabbles in woodworking and sells some of his work at the shop. The recession could actually work in the Henrys’ favor in a couple ways, Matt said. “It may even spike when the economy is down because, when people are laid off, there is nothing else to do, and they may as well go fishing,” he said. “I’d say it’s about the cheapest hobby left.” Although fishermen can spend large amounts of money for equipment and boats, the Henrys said they also can get started with a license and minimal equipment for about $50. Another potential benefit from the poor economy is stimulus money offered from the government. Matt Henry applied for $100,000 to hire employees, purchase more inventory and even open up a second store. “I said, just for the heck of it, apply for it,” Wess said he told his son. Matt Henry, 24, said he’s counting on the business lasting well into the future. “I hope it’s here for the next 40 years,” Matt Henry said. “Essentially, this is what I want to make my life’s work.” Matt Henry, left, and his father, Wess Henry, opened Drowned Worm Bait Shop at 197 N. Cedar St. (Michael Lehmkuhle, The Advocate)",

    "sentence": "Pakistan to restore chief justice ousted by Musharraf. ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Pakistan agreed Monday to reinstate a fired chief justice, a move that will help defuse a political crisis that has sparked street battles and raised fears of instability in the country at a time of surging Islamist violence. Opposition leaders and lawyers had vowed to sit-in at the parliament later Monday until Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, known for his independence and willingness to challenge authority, was reinstated. The capital has been barricaded and scores of extra police brought in amid fears of violence. In a dawn address to the nation that capped a night of high drama, Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani announced Chaudhry would be sworn in on March 21, the day the current chief justice was due to retire. The speech triggered scenes of jubilation outside Chaudhry's home in the capital, Islamabad. Gilani also ordered all lawyers and political activists arrested over the past week to be freed immediately. The concession came as thousands of protesters led by Nawaz Sharif, the head of the largest opposition party and a longtime foe of President Asif Ali Zardari, were traveling to Islamabad to join the planned sit-in. Sharif joined the convoy after ignoring a house arrest order in his hometown of Lahore in Punjab, where his supporters fought running battles with police. \"This is a victory for the people of this country,\" said Baz Mohammad Kakar, a leader of the lawyers' movement. \"Chaudhry is the first chief justice in the history of Pakistan who has proved himself to be a judge for the people, as a chief justice for the people.\" Former President Pervez Musharraf fired Chaudhry, 60, in 2007 after he took up cases challenging the leader's rule, sparking a wave of protests that helped force Musharraf from power in 2008. Musharraf's successor, Zardari, pledged to reinstate Chaudhry within 30 days of taking office, but reneged on the promise, apparently fearing the justice might examine a deal that he and his wife, slain politician Benazir Bhutto, struck with Musharraf to grant the pair immunity from prosecution over alleged corruption cases. Lawyers and civil rights activists have remained committed to the cause of Chaudhry's reinstatement, believing it was a vital first step in getting an independent judiciary in Pakistan.",

    "sentence": "Salmon collapse caused by natural, manmade causes. The roots of last year's unprecedented decision to close the California coast to salmon fishing took hold three years earlier, in the spring of 2005 when juvenile fish swam through the Golden Gate to an ocean lacking ample food for them, a new report says. On the Farallon Islands bird sanctuary, nearly all the Cassin's auklets, which eat the same kind of food as juvenile salmon, abandoned their nests that year. Gray whales that migrate along the coast were reported emaciated and sea lions were found searching for food far from shore. The salmon that would have returned to spawn in 2007 starved, or were weakened and eaten by other fish or birds. The same thing happened in 2006, causing low numbers to return again last year. Naturally varying ocean conditions were the immediate cause of a fishing season closure for which $170 million in federal disaster funds were made available last year, according to a report released Wednesday by a team of scientists assigned last year to investigate the collapse. But if ocean conditions have always varied, why did the salmon numbers fall so precipitously? The scientists who wrote the report contend that while ocean conditions were bad, California's salmon have been so weakened by loss of habitat, water diversions and reliance on hatcheries that they were especially vulnerable. The report focused on the cause of the commercially valuable workhorse of California's salmon fishery — the Sacramento River fall run of chinook salmon. Those fish may have produced as many as 900,000 spawners in years past, but in 2007 just 88,000 fish returned. Last year was even lower, and regulators expect just 122,000 spawners this fall. The National Marine Fisheries Service, meanwhile, has concluded that state water operations are threatening other salmon runs, steelhead, green sturgeon and the Puget Sound population of salmon-eating orcas — even to the point of extinction. That agency is expected to develop new restrictions on water managers by June. But for the fall run, the biggest problems have been ocean conditions and a heavy reliance on hatcheries to produce fish — hatcheries that are meant to make up for the loss of spawning habitat that is blocked by dams. In particular, California's rivers and streams produced so few wild salmon that as much as 90 percent of the state's salmon, according to one recent study, have evolved in hatcheries. The lack of genetic diversity leaves salmon as vulnerable to ups and downs as an investor without a diversified portfolio. \"The system we have of having everything the same, we can expect less variation, and we can expect more booms and busts,\" said Churchill Grimes, director of a federal fisheries science laboratory in Santa Cruz and co-leader of the study. \"You don't have any hedging.\" In the past, if food was scarce in the spring there might still be a lot of juvenile salmon swimming under the Golden Gate later in the spring when the food might be available. But not so in recent years. The lack of food off the coast in the spring of 2005 and 2006 was caused by the weak upwelling — where nutrient-rich waters off the coast rise toward the surface and, in a good year, cause an explosion of marine life that is especially apparent in places like the Farallon Islands. The head of a major commercial fishing association said the report was on the right track but too heavily focused on ocean problems, for which little can be done. \"They got it about half-right,\" said Zeke Grader, executive director of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations. \"We've got to be able to get these fish down the rivers, through the Delta to the ocean. These are things they have avoided in the past because they're controversial.\" Grader contends that dams, pumps and water management policies are to blame for the collapse. Ocean conditions have improved in recent years and that, combined with new restrictions on water pumping out of the Delta, could help fuel a recovery next year, Grader said. It's virtually assured that regulators will close the California coastal salmon fishing season to commercial anglers again this year. A final recommendation is expected to be made at a meeting in early April in Millbrae.",

On a typical day, the 96-year-old Fremont woman receives a lunch delivery from Linda Wasserman, a 16-year volunteer with Fremont-based LIFE ElderCare Meals on Wheels. But on this day, Wasserman brought along a special guest — her husband, Bob, the city's mayor. \"Hi, nice to meet you,\" the mayor said, extending his hand for a handshake. \"It's nice to meet you, too \"... I read about you all the time,\" said Stubblefield, who later joked that she would have worn her Oakland A's hat had she known the mayor would be coming. Wasserman was a big A's supporter when the team proposed moving to Fremont. Wasserman was one of three local mayors to go into their communities Wednesday to deliver meals to senior citizens as part of the annual Mayors for Meals Day. Mayors David W. Smith of Newark and Michael Sweeney of Hayward also delivered food to their constituents, joining more than 1,000 mayors across the country in the effort. Each day, 2,200 homebound seniors in Alameda County receive food from one of six regionally run Meals on Wheels programs. For these seniors, the visits are more than just a meal delivery service; they're a chance to talk to someone. \"It does put you in touch with reality,\" he said. Wasserman said he enjoyed the experience and opportunity to get into the community. He said he also appreciates the efforts of the everyday volunteers — the 225 in the Tri-City area — who work together to deliver some 350 meals a day, 90,000 annually.

    "sentence": "New Haven trustees consider parcel tax. UNION CITY — Hoping to avert further erosion of district services because of state budget cuts, the New Haven school board has hired consultants to determine the likelihood that voters would support a parcel tax to fund school programs. But board members are split over whether to ask voters for money when families increasingly are strapped for cash. One trustee, who supported further consideration of a tax, implied that the timing is not ideal. Just last November, voters agreed to tax themselves $3.2 million annually for eight years to pay for public-safety services. Nevertheless, school board President Gertrude Gregorio said, \"We cannot wait for Sacramento to give us adequate funding. ... I know this is not the best time to ask our community for more money, but ... if the budget continues the way it is, there's no way we can afford to give our children (what we want). It's an expensive proposition, but it's needed.\" In a 3-2 vote, with trustees Michelle Matthews and Gwen Estes dissenting, the board on Tuesday approved hiring two consulting groups for a maximum of $54,500 to conduct initial assessments to determine voter interest in a tax. Any decision to place a tax measure on a ballot would require another board vote. At this point, Superintendent Kari McVeigh said, \"What we're really trying to find out is, 'Will this community support any parcel tax, and if so, under what terms and how much?'\" \" Another firm, Hahn and Associates, will act as political consultants and help craft messages to the public about the need for a tax. Last spring, the school board slashed $7 million. This year, it's made $4 million in budgetary adjustments through cuts and borrowing money from itself, and has approved $5.9 million more in cuts from the 2009-10 and 2010-11 budgets. With the reductions, the district plans to increase class sizes, stop offering co-curricular activities, eliminate its busing program and possibly close an elementary school in the next two years. New Haven is not the only district to consider turning to voters for additional revenue. The Fremont school board recently directed its superintendent to meet with consultants to discuss a similar parcel tax and is scheduled to receive an update next week. Newark officials also have mentioned the idea of a tax measure.",

    "sentence": "Old bills never die, they just wait for votes. Bay Area lawmakers continue to resurrect bills that died in previous Congresses, hoping that having a wider margin of majority in the House and a Democrat in the White House could bring the bills success this time around. For example, Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Oakland, and U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., today reintroduced their Responsible Education About Life, or REAL, Act, which would authorize federal funding for comprehensive, age-appropriate, medically accurate sex education. For now, such funding is available only for abstinence-only-until-marriage programs, which have been shown to exclude important information about contraception as a protection against pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. \"It's time for us to get REAL about sex education,\" Lee said in her news release. \"We should absolutely be teaching young people about abstinence, but we shouldn't be holding back information that can save lives and prevent unwanted pregnancies. Instead of 'abstinence only,' what we're proposing is 'abstinence-plus.' \" Elsewhere, Rep. Jerry McNerney, D-Pleasanton, today introduced H.R.1546, the Caring for Veterans with Traumatic Brain Injury Act of 2009. The bill would establish a special panel within the Department of Veterans Affairs to assess the department's capacity to treat veterans who have traumatic brain injuries as well as to make recommendations on developing policies for care and rehabilitation. It also would help establish TBI-specific education and training programs for VA's health professionals. \"Many of our soldiers who have been wounded in Iraq have experienced a traumatic brain injury. In fact, traumatic brain injuries are the hallmark injuries of this war,\" McNerney said in his news release. \"It is incumbent on us to ensure that the (Department of Veterans Affairs) is equipped and ready to provide the ongoing services necessary to fully address the impact of traumatic brain injuries.\" McNerney had introduced a similar bill in May 2007, but that bill never emerged from committee. Tom Del Beccaro of Lafayette, vice chairman of the California Republican Party, today is helping to launch a new political action committee, called the \"First Amendment Now Campaign.\" The PAC is intended to combat what Del Beccaro says are Democratic efforts to curtail conservative political speech. The main issue is the Fairness Doctrine, a Federal Communications Commission policy dating from 1949 but abolished in 1987 that required broadcast license holders to present controversial issues of public importance in a way the FCC considered honest, equitable and balanced. Although President Barack Obama repeatedly has said he opposes reinstating it and the U.S. Senate last month overwhelmingly approved an amendment nixing it, conservatives have continued to rally against it, leading some critics to wonder whether it's an intentional effort to dangle some red meat as a distraction from other issues. Still, Del Beccaro, California Political News and Views publisher Steve Frank and state Sen. Tony Strickland, R-Moorpark, along with a bunch of conservative talk-radio personalities, are launching this new organization, asking for donations of $17.76 \"to preserve our freedom.\" Besides the Fairness Doctrine, they say, they're concerned about Obama's calls for \"localism,\" or requiring broadcast license holders to dedicate some of their airtime to the interests of their local community — obviously a concern for a conservative station such as KSFO-AM/560 that's located in an overwhelmingly liberal media market such as the Bay Area. And they're also worried about Obama's calls for broadcast media ownership diversity, dating to 2007 and echoed now in Congress. The president and supporters claim they're concerned about a lack of female and minority ownership in the broadcast media, but opponents claim it's just another backdoor way to undercut conservative free speech. So, expect to hear a lot about this all across your AM radio dial as this new organization holds a kickoff rally Tuesday in Sacramento, on the Capitol's north steps, and as it moves forward with an effort to gather a million petition signatures that it can present to U.S. Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, both of California. The PAC promises to use its money \"to preserve the First Amendment; to oppose the Fairness Doctrine, government-imposed diversity and localism; and to oppose candidates that favor the Fairness Doctrine.\"",

This story reflects her love for baseball and its impact on her family. * * *It's the crack of the bat, the roar of the crowd. Baseball season is just around the corner. Springtime brings warm weather, new flowers and baseball. Only true baseball fans think this way and I can attest to being one of them. At a very young age, I already knew baseball was special and important to my family. Many times baseball was the talk around our dinner table and when the new Minnesota Twins baseball franchise first had its game broadcast on the radio in 1960, my dad listened almost religiously. Farm work could wait a few hours. As I grew older, the family baseball tales were imprinted on my brain. My dad played the game and remembered the greats like Babe Ruth - idols for all the players who dreamed of glory while playing town team baseball. Baseball here in Cedar County goes back more than 100 years and still has dedicated players and fans. It was a regular source of entertainment, and a source of bragging rights for years to come. A few years ago, I wrote a story about local Cedar County town baseball, \"The Boys of Summer\" for the Daily News. Much to my surprise, I was subsequently contacted by Rick Baxter, president of the Nebraska State Baseball Association, who had read the article. From him, I learned about the Nebraska Baseball Hall of Fame and its Web site. A year ago, I decided what a wonderful tribute it would be to my father's family to submit their names for consideration. Last fall, I was notified - they were in. Just on Sunday, we accepted a medal of honor for the Bernard Becker family, and no one was probably prouder than my brother and I.I'm sure my dad and uncles were standing right there beside us. I could feel their baseball spirit gently whispering in our midst. \"Let's play ball.\"",

Janet Johnson, a guidance counselor at Norfolk High School, works with Brenda Mercado, a junior at Norfolk High, on some college and career options. Johnson said she’s aware of a number of high school students who are having to work part time while going to high school in order to help support their families during this challenging economic times. Thinking of taking a year or two off after high school to work before starting college? If so, Janet Johnson, a guidance counselor at Norfolk High School, has some advice to offer. First, it's important for students to check what will happen to their health insurance if they hope to stay on their parents' coverage but do not attend school full time. That can be a big consideration for some young people. \"The other thing that I encourage them to do is if they're going to work full time is to really stop and plan how they're going to budget their money so that they don't get used to having all of that income,\" Johnson said. \"If they return to school and have fewer hours and their expenses have expanded to their whole paycheck, that can be really difficult. \"Johnson said it's important for these young people to make a budget so they know how much they can afford to spend and save each month so they do not become over-obligated financially. A period of full-time work can sometimes be an encouragement to certain young people who have postponed college, she said. \"Sometimes that year or two off working full time or working at a job that maybe really isn't their favorite thing to do can be kind of motivating,\" Johnson said. \"Going to college becomes an incentive to getting a job that a (young person) wants more then the job they're currently doing. \"Johnson said taking time off between high school and college can be a challenge for some students academically. Study habits, formulas in math and concepts in science and English may be forgotten over time, but Johnson said colleges provide tutoring and resource centers for students who need extra help.",

Not only did school administrators and three school board members get to hear the concerns and questions of parents and supporters of Sunny Meadow, but audience members also heard some background and factual information about the process the district is going through in looking ahead to the next school year and a new budget. Marlene Uhing, superintendent of schools, organized the meeting at the district's central office administration building. Sunny Meadow's part-time principal Chad Boyer and several other administrators were present, as well as three school board members - Brad Krivohlavek, Clark Froehlich and Alfredo Ramirez. The focus of the meeting was a recent administration announcement that the school is being recommended for closure. The recommendation came during a Sunny Meadow Parent Teacher Organization meeting on March 10 - one day after the board of education heard recommendations from the Shaping the Future committee regarding instructional issues. The committee - made up of administrators, staff and parents of students - recommended a district-wide grade configuration, consolidation of some programs and the relocation of certain programs, including the Montessori, Early Childhood and the alternative school. The Montessori program has been considered by the administrative team to move into the Sunny Meadow building with existing Sunny Meadow students dispersed into other elementary schools in Norfolk. Uhing provided information and some background details on the Shaping the Future and administrative team recommendations, as well as to address concerns regarding the committee. \"Not every (school) building was represented\" on the committee, Uhing said. \"We had people volunteer, we had people nominated by staff members, we had principals make recommendations for that. It was pretty much open to everyone who volunteered to get involved. \"Uhing stressed that the committee did what it was asked to do - review information gathered from several sources, including community forums, and to make recommendations to the board of education. \"They did what they were asked to do and they did a nice job of it. I think it's important to be fair with that group,\" Uhing said. Uhing also emphasized the need for the district to consolidate some programs because of budget limitations. She said it is the job of the administration and the board of education to consider the overall needs of the district and to think locally but act globally. \"What's most important? Are buildings going to be more important to us than keeping people and keeping programs? . . . My personal feeling is, and the administration team recommendation is, that if we can keep people and programs, that's what we're going to try and do,\" Uhing said. She also addressed the Montessori program and reiterated the fact that it is a public - not a private - program within the district. Uhing also mentioned that it has been a part of the district for longer than Sunny Meadow, which was absorbed by the district when Class I elementary-only schools were required to be absorbed by K-12 districts following the passage of LB126. The focus of Monday's meeting, Uhing said, was to hear the public concerns and questions, not to address directly them at that point. She said all of the information shared Monday night would be taken to the entire board of education for discussion and consideration.",

The city council Monday heard from representatives of a Denison, Iowa-based firm called bluespace creative that does branding for companies across the country. \"A brand, in a nutshell, is perception,' said Scott Winey, creative director. Councilman Karl Reeder said a lot of work has been done and money spent on the effort under way to write a plan to develop the North Fork River corridor through downtown Norfolk. He asked what the Iowa company would do. Winey said the work includes interviewing community leaders, drafting an assessment and recommendations, a brand standards guide, visitors guide and logos and work on the city's Web site. The council is taking the idea under consideration.",

Twenty-three Boy Scout and Cub Scout units from throughout Northeast Nebraska's Diamond Dick District will help fight hunger in \"Scouting for Food 2009\" scheduled for Saturday, April 4. Scouts first will be distributing door hangers this Saturday, March 28, in Norfolk and area communities. The door hangers will provide information about plans to pick up donated non-perishable food items starting at 8 a.m. on April 4. The food items collected will be given to local food pantries. Five Scout units from Norfolk - Pack 122, 124 and 131 and Troop 122 and 124 - will collect items for the Salvation Army, Improved Living Norfolk food bank and the Trinity Episcopal Church food pantry. Hy-Vee East, Hy-Vee West and Lou's Thrifty Way will be helping this year by having a collection site where consumers can drop off items in the stores this week through April 4. Scouts will pick them up and deliver those items to food pantries, too. In addition to the Norfolk, efforts:- Pack 198 and Troop 198 from Battle Creek will be collecting for the Battle Creek food pantry. - Pack 174 and Troop 174 from Wayne, with help from Pack 179 and Troop 179 from Winside, will be collecting for the Wayne Food Pantry. - Pack 149 and Troop 149 from Bloomfield will be collecting for the Knox County Food Pantry. - Pack 178 and Troop 178 from Pierce will be collecting for the Food Bank at the United Congregational Church of Christ in Pierce.

    "sentence": "Vandals target 4x4s in Oxford. A SPATE of vandalised 4x4 vehicles has sparked fears an eco-fanatic is targeting “gas guzzling” cars in Oxford. Builder Phillip Bradley has seen his new £25,000 Isuzu attacked outside his home in Osney Island four times, leaving him with a £1,700 repair bill. Over the past fortnight his vehicle has been vandalised twice. Another 4x4 owner nearby has also had his windscreen of his Toyota Hilux repeatedly smashed since January. People in Osney Island have been shocked by the level of car vandalism in recent weeks, with the damage always happening at weekends in the early hours of the morning. But residents are now convinced the vandalism is not random, as 4x4s are suffering the brunt of the attacks. One owner on Osney Island has now taken to sleeping in his vehicle at night in the hope of catching his tormentor. And he has also had CCTV cameras put in front of his house. Mr Bradley said his Isuzu Denver Rodeo was first damaged just two days after he bought it in October, when the windscreen was smashed. The car had been parked outside his home in West Street. The latest attack happened on Friday night when the windscreen was again smashed and the bonnet pierced — apparently with a heavy metal spike. Mr Bradley, a father-of-two who owns the building firm Attics +, said he was disturbed at 4am by a loud smashing noise. He had been sleeping in the front bedroom of his house to keep watch over his vehicle. But the offender had fled down Swan Street by the time he had rushed to his car. Mr Bradley said: “I had thought I was the victim of some personal vendetta when if first happened. But then I heard about another guy in East Street having his 4x4 damaged. I don’t believe we are talking about youngsters who have been to the clubs, or the hooded crew. This seems to be someone who is on a mission. “It is someone who is going to keep on coming back until he is caught. “My guess is that it’s someone who perceives cars like mine to be a ‘gas guzzler’. “It isn’t. It actually takes diesel. I bought it because it’s a nice car for the family and I can also use it at work. The owner of the vandalised Toyota Hilux is Ian Beesley, also a builder, who lives on Ferry Hinksey Road. Mr Beesley, widely known as Digger, said his car had been parked on only yards from his home when it was vandalised. He also feared a misguided ecologically-minded fanatic was the most likely culprit. A spokesman for Oxford Police said: “The neighbourhood policing team have increased their patrols in the area and are carrying out investigations to catch those responsible.”",

    "sentence": "Students go into Oxford's Dragon's Den. SCHOOLCHILDREN in Oxford have been putting forward business ideas before a panel of “Business Angels” in the city’s own version of hit television programme Dragon’s Den. Pupils from three city schools gave pitches to a panel of Angels under the new Business X scheme — all for a share of £30,000. Pupils at Matthew Arnold School, in Botley, St Gregory the Great School in East Oxford and Magdalen College School, Cowley Place, have been working on their proposals for months with the help of MBA students from the Said Business School. After several hours, the panel of venture capitalists, businessmen and women and entrepreneurs, agreed to invest in two of the schemes, pending further information. St Gregory the Great School’s team, which was seeking funds to develop a community allotment, got the backing of the panel. They asked for £4,800 and have been told they will get financial backing, though the final figure has not yet been agreed. Team member Vaughan Matthews, 17, from Cowley, said: “It was a great experience. It was very difficult. Most of us have seen Dragon’s Den and you can criticise the show, but until you’re in that position, you can’t describe what it’s like.” Philip Blackwell, from the Blackwell family behind the famous Broad Street bookshop, told the group: “We loved it and we thought you were enthusiastic, ambitious, and your scheme had great environmental and social benefits.” The Angels decided against investing in Matthew Arnold School’s specialist puzzle cube, but were so impressed by the way the group worked together, they offered to work with them to find a different product. They had asked for £15,000 for a laser cutter to create the cube, aimed at the disabled market. Adam Newport, 14, from Botley, said: “We have all put a lot of work in this, all of us have pulled our weight and it has been interesting.” Two different groups from Magdalen College School took part in the contest, with business ideas for a yearbook company and for an environmental social networking site. The panel decided to invest in the first scheme, but not in the second. Ely Sandler, from the yearbook project called Form, said: “We have put a lot of effort into this and Business X has been very helpful. “It is a really good idea and it’s a great way to get us started.” The different groups will report back to the Business Angels on July 1. Venture capitalist Martin Chilcott, who came up with the scheme and was on the panel, said: “We were enormously impressed with the quality of the work and of the presentations, energy, enthusiasm and passion.”",

    "sentence": "Headington: Mum jailed for fake passport. A FAILED asylum seeker was jailed for 11 months yesterday after using a fake passport to work as a carer. Pauline Munene, 49, used a fake Kenyan passport to gain work with Chrysalis Community Care, formerly known as Blue Arrow, while living in Gladstone Road, Headington, Oxford. She was caught after a raid on her home last November. Oxford Crown Court heard Munene arrived in the UK from Nairobi in 2002 but her asylum application was rejected two years later. Munene admitted two charges of deception, two of possessing false identity documents with intent and one of fraud. Stephen Parker, defending, said Munene had been funding her 15-year-old daughter’s education back in Kenya. Judge Julian Hall said: “You have played fast and loose with the immigration rules in this country but simultaneously you have been a useful person to have here, doing work that a lot of people would not do. “But rules are rules and I have to punish you for breaking them.”",

It devised the scheme as a rival to the original plan to build 15,000 homes near Weston-on-the-Green. Cherwell claims Weston Otmoor would damage Bicester and Kidlington, while its own plan would benefit the former. But villagers and landowners mounted angry opposition at tonight's meeting, rounding on the north west option's chief architect, Cherwell leader Barry Wood. They have complained the scheme was drawn up without consulting them. Patrick Woodrow, of Bucknell, told Mr Wood to \"find his spine\" and stand up to housing minister Margaret Beckett. Landowner Rosemary Henson, of Himley farm in Chesteron, said: \"I bitterly resent being thrown to the wolves as a decoy to divert attention from Weston Otmoor.\" But Mr Wood said the development would represent prosperity and investment in Bicester. He added the infrastructure Bicester desperately needed would only come with a large scale development like the north west Bicester proposal. Councillors backed the move to officially put North West Bicester in front of the Government as a better option to Weston Otmoor. A shortlist of ecotowns is expected to be drawn up in the summer.",

    "sentence": "Cancer drugs prompt Bicester teenager's slim. A TEENAGER who is fighting leukaemia has joined a slimming club after being told by doctors to lose weight. Matthew Holder-Wooloff, 15, from Bicester, was introduced to Slimming World classes by his mother just over a year ago, after his treatment for leukaemia caused him to pile on over two stone. The steroids that doctors prescribed for Matthew, a student at The Cooper School in Bicester, after he was diagnosed with the blood and bone marrow cancer also reduced his bone density, so the young rugby fan found he was too weak to play his favourite sport. Matthew’s mother, Jackie, said: “Matthew was diagnosed in 2007. We thought he had come down with a really bad cold and cough and couldn’t seem to shake it off, so we took him to the doctors. “As part of the treatment he was given steroids and one of the side effects is a huge appetite.” Matthew, who is 5ft 8ins tall, saw his weight jump from about 12 stone to 14 stone. Mrs Holder-Wooloff said: “I decided to take Matthew to Slimming World because I’d seen how well it worked for other members of my family. “We ran it past the hospital and they were very happy with the idea. “My sister’s family lost about 17 stone between four of them there, so we knew it worked. “When he was in hospital I found I gained a lot of weight too because I was spending all of my time with him and living on food from the cafe, so I went with him.” In the year Mrs Holder-Wooloff and her son have been members, she has lost two stone and Matthew has shed a stone and half. According to Slimming World, its members lose weight through a combination of a healthy diet, moderate exercise, and group support sessions where members are encouraged to shun bad eating habits. The sessions cost £4.50 a week, but children between 11 and 15 can join for free if they are accompanied by a parent or guardian. Although it will be another 14 months before Matthew can be given the all-clear from the disease, he and his mother intend to carry on with the weekly sessions at Southwold School, in Holm Way, Bicester. Matthew said: “It has absolutely been such a big change for me, but I am much happier with what I’m eating. “I’ve had more steroid treatment recently, which caused me to put a bit of the weight back on, but now I know what to do to lose it again.” Mrs Holder-Wooloff added: “It’s still difficult for him because he can’t do his sports, and even swimming is off because of the tubes that go into his body. But he has definitely slimmed down and is happier.” * Oxford GP Dr Tia MacGregor, who is based at St Bartholomew's Surgery in Manzil Way, East Oxford, backed the idea as a good way to combat the effect steroids have on a patient’s metabolism. She added: “I would be wary of some of the ‘faddier’ diets that suggest dropping calorie intake to something ridiculous like 400 a day, but recognised classes such as these are perfectly fine.”",

    "sentence": "Religious rage at Oxfordshire's contraceptive pill by text. A SCHEME to allow schoolchildren in Oxfordshire to ask for the morning-after pill by text message has been condemned by religious leaders. From July, girls as young as 11 at four secondary schools in Oxford and two in Banbury will be able to text requests for the pill – without their parents’ knowledge – if they have had unprotected sex, or believe contraception has failed. The move outraged members of the Catholic Church – however both authorities say they have received no complaints about the scheme. Chairman of the Oxford Central Mosque Sabir Hussain Mirza said: “I’m absolutely shocked this kind of thing is happening. “This is a disaster allowing under-age children to do this without the knowledge of their parents. “There’s too much freedom given to the children and they don’t know the meaning of their freedom.” Rabbi Eli Brackman, leader of the Oxford’s Jewish society said: “Britain has long had the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in Europe. “However, I believe strongly that parents need to be involved in a child’s upbringing and any measures that sideline that relationship is not healthy for the child and not healthy for society.” But Anglican minister Roger Burne, a former GP, expressed his support for the scheme. Mr Burne, minister at the Church of the Holy Family in Blackbird Leys, said: “It sounds an eminently sensible idea to me. “They are using text as a means of putting young girls who are in trouble in touch with professional help. “I’d far rather girls in that situation had that conversation, whatever the outcome of them taking the morning-after pill or not, if they are concerned. Dr Burne, a former GP at St Bartholomew's in Cowley Road added: “Going to see your doctor particularly if you’re young is not an easy thing to do especially if they are your family doctor regardless of whether it should be confidential. “If my daughter was 15 and worried that she maybe pregnant I’d far rather she had the chance to make an initial contact in a way that was comfortable for her.” “I would be worried about not confiding in parents but sometimes that’s not the easiest thing to do.” Carole Partlett, a teenage pregnancy support worker at the John Radcliffe Hospital, said: “I think it’s a really good idea. “Kids text all the time and the way I make most of my contacts with young mums is through texting.",

    "sentence": "Oxford clothes swapping parties look Swish! . WOMEN raced to get their hands on each other’s clothes during a charity fundraiser in Oxford. The ‘swishing’ event, at Baby Simple bar in Cowley Road on Saturday, was held in aid of pioneering East Oxford children’s hospice Helen & Douglas House. Dozens of women of all ages brought in clothes they no longer wanted and exchanged them for new items. They each paid a £5 fee to take part in the event, with all proceeds going to the Magdalen Road hospice. Helen Cordiner, a fundraising assistant at the hospice, said: “People were really generous and the feedback was that they all spotted something they liked.” Doors opened an hour before the ‘swish’ began, giving participants a chance to hand over clothes, bags, shoes, accessories and jewellery, and check out what other people had to offer. There was no fighting in the aisles but high-fives were exchanged as the fashionistas managed to get their hands on coveted items of clothing. She said: “I think it’s a brilliant idea — I had never heard of swishing before this.” Anna Winstanley, 25, from Marston, brought several coats that didn’t fit or that she had bought on a whim. She successfully swished them for a dress and skirt she spotted early on. Ms Winstanley said: “I came with a few friends and we had spies around the room who knew what we wanted. “I think it’s a brilliant idea, especially in the current economic climate, and Helen & Douglas House is a brilliant cause.” Fiona Evans, 27, who works at the hospice organising activity events, said: “I brought a bag with about 20 things in it and me and my friend actually swished before we got here between the two of us. Miss Cordiner said she hoped Saturday’s fundraiser, which attracted about 30 people, would be the first of many similar events. She also called on people to organise their own swishing sessions among friends, where they could charge a small fee to go towards the hospice. CLOTHES swapping parties first started in America several years ago but have started coming into their own in the UK in the last two years. Swishes are often arranged by ethical charities, with the idea being that clothes swapping stops good quality clothes being thrown away, and means people can update their wardrobes for free. Celebrities such as Kylie, Naomi Campbell and Kelly Osbourne have handed over their own clothes for swishing parties, and Gwyneth Paltrow and Lindsay Lohan are said to be confirmed fans. Twiggy is credited with popularising the fad on her Frock Exchange TV show.",

    "sentence": "IRS audit finds Butler County employees should have been paying taxes on perks. HAMILTON — Staring down the barrel of a potential $500,000 assessment for back taxes, Butler County Auditor Roger Reynolds said the county is drafting policies to make sure employees pay taxes on fringe benefits in the future. It's unclear why the county wasn't paying these taxes. Former deputy auditor Randy Groves said in 2007 county officials were unaware these items were taxable until shortly before an ongoing Internal Revenue Service audit began that year. That audit is wrapping up now, and is finding that county employees should have paid taxes on roughly $1.5 million for perks such as use of county cars, cell phones and uniforms. Since the county didn't report those perks as income, that bill may soon go to the county. While county leaders agree the county will comply, some also question the wisdom of the tax code. For example, the IRS wants to tax employees who are given county cell phones because they could use them off the clock. But county policy prohibits employees from using cell phones for personal use. \"Why is the telephone on my desk any different from my cell phone?\" said Commissioner Gregory Jolivette, who called the IRS rule \"crazy.\" The IRS wants to tax the county for roughly $580,000 spent on employee cell phones, roughly $720,000 spent on uniforms and roughly $250,000 for vehicles employees take home. This includes parts of uniforms worn by sheriff's deputies, such as T-shirts and certain pants that could conceivably be worn mowing the lawn at home. But a deputy would be fired for doing so, according to Sheriff's Office Chief Deputy Anthony Dwyer. In addition to deputies, Jolivette said it's vital that utility workers and others in the public have uniforms that clearly identify them as county employees. \"Is that worker, when not in the field, supposed to go back to the office and change into a shirt that they own to go out to lunch?\" Jolivette said. \"It doesn't make sense.\" Other fringe benefits the IRS wants to tax are tuition reimbursement, travel allowances and parking passes. Reynolds said the original assessment against the county was higher than $500,000 and could go down further as he works with a tax attorney in negotiations with the IRS. \"We are currently working on reducing the outstanding amount,\" he said. But he's not looking for a fight with the tax man. \"The IRS has its rules,\" he said. \"It's not for me to decide what those rules are, it's up to me to adhere to those rules as put forward by the IRS and I'll do that to the best of my ability.\"",

    "sentence": "Agency puts emphasis on Ohio 63 extension. By emphasizing plans to extend Ohio 63 west as a potential multi-modal project, county officials hope federal funding will become more likely. The Butler County Transportation Improvement District has passed a resolution to designate Ohio 63 as a multi-modal project. The project has the potential of opening up new transportation routes through Monroe, Trenton and Seven Mile. It also has the possibility of connecting the county to major routes such as Interstates 75 and 70 and U.S. 127, as well as rail, said Ron Porter, TID director. With so much emphasis at the federal level for incorporating multiple systems of transportation into projects, the prioritization could help obtain federal funding, said Bill Triick, TID board member and president of the Chamber of Commerce Serving Middletown, Trenton and Monroe. The business community has been overwhelming in support of the project due to the lower transportation costs it would afford them by offering a more direct route, Triick said. \"That highway was never supposed to stop at Route 4. There is no major commercialization in the northern part of the county and that is due to lack of infrastructure,\" he said. The extension has been a priority for the county for many years, but has had issues obtaining funding. The TID submitted the project, estimated to cost $138.2 million, to the Ohio Department of Development for potential federal stimulus funding. The funding is still a major concern for the city of Monroe, which has yet to pass a resolution supporting the extension as requested by the TID. The roadway would reach five miles into the city, according to county engineer Greg Wilkens. \"The biggest concern is who is going to maintain that bridge across the river,\" said Monroe Mayor Robert Routson. \"It could potentially be St. Clair Twp., Madison Twp., Trenton or Monroe. Someone has got to assume responsibility to maintain that bridge.\" While Routson said he would support the project, he indicated the project would be more beneficial to the county and Trenton than Monroe.",

All three winners were amazed at their success, and it hadn't quite sunk in Sunday night at the Heaven Sent Wedding Chapel. \"I pretty much can't think about this yet,\" said Zoz, a 20-year-old University of Cincinnati student. Zoz will receive a $500 college scholarship and the chance to compete for the Miss Ohio title in Mansfield this June. The Mansfield winner may then compete for the Miss America title. \"It's really great. I'm just thankful I won,\" said Million. She also won the People's Choice Award by popular vote from the audience. The contestants had to impress a panel of judges based on their skill at answering questions, modeling swimsuits and evening wear, and their performing talent. The first runner-ups were Hannah Smalls of Oxford in the Little Miss category, Kaitlin Craig of Elida in the Teen category and Devon Stansbury of Rockford in the Miss category.

BUTLER COUNTY — Butler County Community health centers are expected to get about $198,000 of $8 million in federal funds to increase staff, hours and expand pediatric care. The money recently released by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to Ohio public health agencies was made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to Ohio community health centers. The funds are meant to help community health centers statewide expand programs at a time when an ever-growing number of Americans are uninsured, officials said. \"It's very timely,\" said Don Reimer, chief financial officer of the Butler County Community Health Consortium. \"We saw an increase in patients in the fourth quarter of 2008 and continue to see an increase in uninsured patients along with a mix of new patients.\" Reimer said county officials will use the additional funds to increase pediatric care, increase hours and staff at its facilities in Hamilton and Middletown. The Butler County Health Consortium is among 32 federally qualified health centers in Ohio that received funds, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The health centers are required to use the funds over the next two years to create or retain approximately 147 health center jobs by expanding operations hours, adding providers or expanding services, HHS officials said. The funds are the second set of health center grants provided through the Recovery Act and will provide care to an additional 51,039 patients in Ohio in the next two years. On March 2, President Obama announced grants worth $155 million to 126 new health centers.",

Officers said they observed the girl exit the bar carrying on open bottle of beer, then stopped her for an open container violation. The suspect, of Pickerington, Ohio, allegedly told police she was in Oxford visiting along with her mother, who had already left the bar. Police said the juvenile initially told them she was 20, but said she had received a wristband marking her as over 21 from her mother. The girl reportedly became belligerent toward officers and was taken to the Oxford Police Department, where dispatchers alerted officers she was actually 16. The girl's mother did not appear concerned that her juvenile daughter was drinking in a bar at 1:40 in the morning, police said, asking officers to not cite her daughter. The juvenile was issued a citation for offenses involving underage persons and was released.",

    "sentence": "Harding reminds audience not to let fear of the world's economy become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Mayor Michael Harding reminded a chamber of commerce audience Thursday morning not to let its fear of the world's economy become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Harding, speaking to the annual Woodstock District Chamber of Commerce Mayor's Breakfast at the Quality Hotel and Suites, parlayed a few anecdotes of looking fear in the face into one of the themes he touched on during his 45-minute presentation. At first referring to a first time skippering a sailboat on Lake Ontario in rough waters, the mayor told and then returned to an experience piloting a glider. Putting the aircraft into a downward spiral, the craft fell 10 storeys before his instructor yelled over his shoulder 'hard left rudder.' \"Just as quickly, the plane corrected itself, because it wants to fly,\" Harding said, repeating the line with a slight change to end his address. \"If we behave totally out of fear, our situation will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Every one of you is tightening your belts, but just like the glider... the plane wants to fly.\" He used these two anecdotes as examples of looking fear in the face and confronting it, extending his point that Woodstock is faring better than others within what's happening in the world economy. Showing slides of panic-driven media coverage of past economic slowdowns -- some of which never materialized -- Harding pointed out how media often fuel the fires of fear. A fear through which one should keep a steady hand on the tiller, or the rudder. He laid out his case pointing to information he's referred to in previous Mayor's Breakfasts -- the city's 25 years of action in buying and servicing industrial land. Doing so feeds the strategy to get an increasing share of property taxes from residential into other classes. Speaking to the city's first industrial park, Patullo Ridge, the mayor pointed out how city council in 1983-84 bought the 126 hectares for the park and serviced it with an initial investment of $2 million. It has reaped $4 million in land sales and 845 jobs since, and its industries have paid $2.7 million in property taxes to the city alone. The return on investment for the city took barely two years. Harding also touched on the 21 new projects within the city in 2008, a list capped by the issuance of the building permit for the new Woodstock General Hospital, the story behind which he said had yet to be fully told. He highlighted other city accomplishments such as the Carnegie Library's 100th anniversary, the new recycling and water conservation programs and changes to public transportation. He also highlighted upcoming successes such as the second phase of Cowan Park and the summer's Ontario ParaSport Games in July. He urged those in attendance to tell the city if they're having difficulties, so the city would have the opportunity to do what it can. \"If you're doing badly, we're doing badly. We can't tax what isn't there,\" Harding said. \"We want to help, our staff wants to help, council wants to help. We'll even hold your hand for a bit, but you have to ask.\"",

    "sentence": "U.S. tries to thaw chilly relationship. Over the past year, the United States and Russia have been drifting into a hostile relationship, driven by the U.S. decision to install anti-missile defences in eastern Europe, the war in Georgia last August, and the recent fiasco over Russian natural gas supplies to Europe. There was nervous chatter about a new Cold War, but last month U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden said that the Obama administration was going to \"press the reset button\" in its relations with Russia. Now it has done it. At the NATO summit on March 5, the alliance agreed to resume high-level contacts with Moscow in the NATO-Russia Council, which were suspended after the Georgian war. The following day, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Brussels and gave him a mock reset button. \"There was a rather confrontational approach toward Russia in the prior administration,\" she explained. None of the disputes and misunderstandings between Washington and Moscow came from a hostile intent on either side. Take the anti-ballistic missile (ABM) defences being built in Poland and the Czech Republic. The Bush administration said the interceptor missiles and radars of the system were there to intercept nuclear-tipped, long-range missiles fired by Iran and expected the Russians to believe it. Not surprising, the Russians didn't believe it, because Iran has neither missiles capable of reaching the United States nor any nuclear warheads to put on them. So Moscow thought the ABM system was really intended to shoot down Russian missiles and thus undermine the country's ability to deter the United States. Russia worked itself into such a lather over the ABM missiles that President Dmitry Medvedev announced on the day after Barack Obama's election victory last November that short-range Russian missiles would be installed in Kaliningrad, a Russian enclave on the Polish border, to destroy those American bases on short notice. But the ABM missiles are in the wrong place to intercept Russian ICBMs, and they don't really work anyway. They have never worked properly, despite tens of billions of dollars poured into the ABM project (a.k.a. \"Star Wars,\" National Missile Defence, etc.) during the past quarter-century. The sole practical result of the program, over the whole of its existence, has been to pour money into the pockets of American defence contractors. But the Russians are too paranoid to accept that, and the program has such strong support in Congress that the Obama administration is merely \"reviewing\" it, rather than cancelling it outright. There are belligerent minor players on both sides, but the Obama administration seems to have sent out orders to squelch them. Last week, for example, a couple of Russian bombers flew to within a couple of hundred kilometres of Canada's Arctic coast, a mere five thousand kilometres from the Canadian capital. Canada scrambled fighters to \"send a strong signal that they should back off and stay out of our airspace,\" according to Defence Minister Peter MacKay, and Prime Minister Stephen Harper sternly declared that Canada would not be intimidated. \"This government has responded every time the Russians have done that,\" he said. \"We will defend our airspace.\" But the Russians were not in Canada's airspace. \"The Russians have conducted themselves professionally,\" responded Gen. Gene Renuart, the American officer who commands NORAD, the Canada-U.S. air defence alliance, in an implicit rebuke to the sabre-rattling Canadians. That is probably just what the Obama administration wants from Russia: a professional relationship between two grownup countries that know and respect the rules. For a start, Hillary Clinton and Sergei Lavrov committed the two countries to negotiate a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) by the end of the year, but more will follow. The tide has turned. Gwynne Dyer is an independent journalist based in London, England.",

    "sentence": "Education minister would like to see boards share vacant spaces. Ontario's education minister said Friday she's ready to write regulations compelling school boards to share vacant space with other school boards and community partners. Kathleen Wynne said she would look to write these regulations as a response to recommendations from a report she commissioned on declining enrolment within the province's schools. \"Closing or consolidating schools is one response to declining enrolment -- in some circumstances, the appropriate response,\" the report states. \"However, many circumstances exist in which school closures are undesirable or even unworkable.\" Several of the report's recommendations focus on encouraging and even mandating school boards to seek out partnerships that would allow vacant space in schools to be used rather than remain empty and become a financial burden. \"The (recommendations) that co-terminous boards be required to share or consider shared facilities -- I was looking for that kind of recommendation if the group deemed it appropriate and they have come through with that,\" Wynne said in a Friday phone interview from her constituency office in Toronto. She said she was also encouraged by the recommendation school boards be required to solicit interest from potential community partners for excess space in their schools. \"We're not just going to encourage this, but write regulations to say this is what should happen,\" Wynne said. \"It's a matter of figuring out how to do it and the language of the regulations.\" She was also encouraged by a related recommendation the province look to use empty space in schools to provide its services before building or leasing space elsewhere. She said it would require action beyond her own ministry, but reinforced the concept of community hubs where Ontarians can access as many services as possible. The report was released by Wynne Friday, and contains 21 recommendations for the Ontario government to help school boards and communities understand and deal with the impact of fewer school-aged children in the province. The group recommends the province and all school boards do a better job of explaining what declining enrolment is and how it affects a school's ability to teach students the skills they need to be successful. It wants the province to mandate a single template for reporting changes in enrolment, and that school boards be required to start considering options for small and declining-enrolment schools before reaching the point where closure or consolidation is seen as the only option. Wynne said she was encouraged by the report's tone and the preference within its recommendations ensuring students are given the best possible learning environments and resources. \"The whole point -- to have the programs in place for kids in schools is a critical one and that's why the charts and information included are very valuable to both boards and parent groups,\" Wynne said. \"We can all get a bit more common understanding of the issue.\" Thames Valley District School Board chair James Stewart admitted in a weekend e-mail the devil on the implementation of the report's recommendations would be in the detail of any regulations Wynne issues. \"Anything that lightens the load of the taxpayer and effectively helps our students is welcome in these times,\" Stewart wrote. The report contains extensive recommendations on changes to the province's per-pupil Education Funding Formula, which has been in place since 1998. It recommends shifting more funding -- for example for computers and technology -- from per-pupil to school-based criteria, clarifying and changing temporary declining enrolment funding currently given to school boards. The report states schools in Ontario already have 68,000 fewer students in their desks than in September 1998, and projects schools will have 72,000 fewer students in by September 2012 than they do today. It was written by a working group of nine people led by Brant MPP Dave Levac and Renfrew County District School Board director of education Eleanor Newman. It also included participation from Thames Valley District School Board treasurer Brian Greene and Southwest Middlesex Mayor Doug Reycraft.",

Bruno figures she's getting a big boost for her buck -- she works in the ultra-competitive and youthful beauty industry, and believes in looking her best in order to attract and keep clients. \"It makes me feel good and when I feel good I'm more creative, successful,\" says Bruno, adding that Botox is an instant pick-me-up, physically and mentally, and its benefits last far longer than any facial or expensive meal out. Bruno isn't the only one refusing to forfeit a facial fix. Dr. David Ellis reports an increase in patients getting non-invasive \"touchie-uppies\" in the past month. \"It gives people an emotional and physical perk -- it's an affordable luxury.\" Expensive surgical procedures are down, he says, but not demand for treatments like injectable fillers, Botox and laser. \"Five patients cancelled surgery in January,\" says the Toronto facial plastic surgeon. Most can't afford time off work to recover and are postponing costly invasive surgery -- up to $20,000 plus -- until the economy stabilizes. Cheaper and cheerful non-surgical \"liquid facelifts,\" combining Botox and Juvederm dermal filler, are popular and can offer \"instantaneous results, a real wow factor,\" says Ellis. In a poll by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, 73% of surgeons report an increased or stable demand for Botox, chemical peels and fillers, while 62% report a decrease in surgical procedures. Dr. Wayne Perron, a Calgary plastic surgeon, reports business is steady on all fronts. In this hyped-up doom and gloom, Botox is \"one of the things that we soothe ourselves with.\" Today, cosmetic procedures are viewed as an investment in staying competitive in a cut-throat job market. Freshening up a resume just isn't enough -- many seek an injection of freshness, a glow and a boost of confidence too. Bruno, owner of Decree in Colour salon, says she got tired of feeling and looking withered and weary, so in 2007 she opted for an injectable filler to add volume to her cheeks and Botox on her forehead. She plans to do around her eyes on her next quarterly visit to Ellis. She says that her clients look to her for inspiration. \"You have to be the power of example,\" says Bruno, who embraces a healthy and active lifestyle. Dr. Barry Lycka isn't surprised people aren't giving up their Botox. \"Once people have it done, it becomes terribly addictive.\" People value looking good and Botox offers instant results with no downtime -- \"you look fresh, like you've been on a vacation for six weeks,\" says the Edmonton cosmetic dermatologist, adding business is at 100% capacity. Invasive cosmetic surgery has been on the decline for the past 10 years \"as people are looking for quicker, better and easier procedures, and now the economy is forcing that even more,\" he says. Many women view cosmetic procedures as a way to get a competitive edge in the workplace, reveals a survey by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. 13% would consider having a cosmetic medical procedure specifically to make them more confident and more competitive in the job market. 3% say they've already had a cosmetic procedure to increase their perceived value in the workplace. 73% believe youthful appearance plays a part in getting hired, getting a promotion or getting new clients. 80% think having a cosmetic procedure can boost a person's confidence. Antonella Bruno would prefer to spend money on Botox injections than spend it on other areas of her life.",

    "sentence": "Luminaries don't yet see light. If a recent blue-ribbon confab for business leaders, analysts and economists is any indication, Canadians who believe the Great Crash will be over soon should probably think about changing meds. An international poll just out shows that despite all the economic doom and gloom -- not to mention terminal winter blahs -- Canadians are among the most optimistic people in the world. The Environics survey, for instance, found 70% of Canucks don't expect the recession to last more than two years. But among those most likely in the know, there is a growing crescendo of expert opinion that anyone who still sees the global economic glass as half-full must be drinking the other half, and it ain't water. Yesterday, Parliament's watchdog of fiscal funny business, federal budget officer Kevin Page, told a Commons committee the Conservative government's latest projections are already being washed away in a tidal wave of red ink. He predicts federal deficits and unemployment will be far higher than government projections as the economy continues to tank. Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney, who recently predicted the economy would bounce back by the end of the year, is now signalling he, too, is tossing the rose-coloured glasses. But the really depressing news came out of a closed-door symposium in Toronto this week exploring \"what lies ahead for the global economy.\" The conclusion is the current global malaise will be much deeper, last much longer, and be far more complicated to cure than most governments are willing to admit. The road to recovery, the experts are saying, is anything but around the corner. Think at least three to five years away. The iconic David Dodge, former Bank of Canada governor and a federal deputy minister of finance for years before that, told the ballroom full of corporate execs that the economy is toast this year, and going to get worse before it gets any better. \"The year 2009 is going to be a very dark page in economic history,\" Dodge told the pinstripe crowd that became decidedly downcast as the day progressed. Dodge agrees with the need for major deficit spending to keep the economy moving in the wake of both business and consumer spending going to the bottom. \"There is virtually nothing policy-makers can do in the coming months that will do anything to affect (economic) outcomes this year,\" Dodge said. Similarly, there will be no instant miracles from the central banks' cutting their key lending rates to near zero. Dodge said even in good economic times when the market is awash with borrowing and spending, interest rate cuts can take nine months or more to have their desired impact. That delay could be even longer in this so-called \"balance sheet recession,\" when economies shift from borrowing and spending to saving and debt reduction. One result, Dodge said, would likely be global unemployment continuing to climb into 2010. Other luminaries speaking at the Toronto symposium included Richard Koo, chief economist for Nomura Securities in Tokyo; Martin Wolf, associate editor of the Financial Times of London; and William A. Macdonald, a Toronto-based strategic consultant and one of this country's engaging thinkers. While they didn't address Canada's economic problems directly -- the fiscal fate of this country, like others, is in the hands of the U.S. and China -- it seems clear the odds of the federal government returning to balanced budgets in the next five years are slim to nil. As for your decimated stock portfolio, don't expect it to bounce back to where it was anytime soon -- apparently about 40% of its value was just air in the bubble now burst.",

    "sentence": "Mixed local reaction towards Ontario budget (click for video). Elliot Ferguson photoJim Harrison of the Woodstock District Chamber of Commerce says it is likely the proposed harmonized sales tax will cost consumers more money. The local reaction to Thursday's Ontario budget speech could best be described as mixed. While local political and business leaders liked aspects of the Liberal budget, there were serious misgivings about the harmonization of the provincial sales tax with the federal GST. The most scathing local indictment of this harmonization came from Oxford MPP Ernie Hardeman, who characterized this shift as the largest tax increase in the province's history. While Hardeman was supportive of the concept of a harmonization, saying he had no argument against more efficient methods of taxation, he was critical of the Liberal government's approach. \"This will be a massive burden on the average citizens of the Province of Ontario,\" he said following Finance Minister Dwight Duncan's budget speech. Because this harmonization will result in the inclusion of goods and services previously exempt from provincial tax, including gasoline and heating fuel, Hardeman said Ontarians would suffer an eight per cent price increase on many staples. The result, he said, would be the generation of an additional $2.3 billion in annual sales tax revenue by 2012. \"That's the reality of it, and that's all on the backs of average citizens,\" the Progressive Conservative agriculture critic said. For Jim Harrison, the president of the Woodstock District Chamber of Commerce, the harmonized sales tax represented a mixed bag. While harmonization has long been a position of the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, Harrison was concerned that adding an eight per cent sales tax to previously exempted goods and services would mean an unwelcome increase to operating costs to Ontario businesses. \"When you add that one key element, it really shakes your opinion of the overall effect,\" he said. \"The increased tax burden on the new items, we'll have to wait and see what happens.\" Harrison suggested some of the mitigation measures intended by the provincial government to offset this potential burden, including personal income tax reductions and one-time thrice yearly \"rebate\" cheques, implied the impact of harmonization could be fairly significant. \"There's an inherent feeling the blow is bigger than the reform,\" he said. Like Hardeman, Harrison suggested the provincial government should have looked at reducing its portion of the harmonized sales tax to offer Ontarians something in the range of 10 per cent to 11 per cent. At the same time, Harrison said the Liberal government was wise to delay the institution of the single sales tax until July 2010. \"That will give everyone some time to understand the process,\" he said. While the impact of this new \"single, value-added tax\" was viewed with some trepidation, local leaders were more impressed with other budget-speech announcements. The promise that garnered the most local praise was the allocation of $32.5 billion in new infrastructure spending, an investment that Duncan estimated would create 300,000 jobs. Even as a member of the Opposition, Hardeman couldn't fault the Liberal government for putting more money into hospitals, roads, schools and affordable housing. \"I can't see anything ... but good (coming from the infrastructure investment),\" Harrison agreed. \"I feel quite positive about that.\" While cautiously optimistic about the announcement of the infrastructure money, Oxford's municipal leaders had questions about the actual details of the eventual disbursement. Noting that his town had been overlooked by provincial infrastructure funding programs in the past, Tillsonburg Mayor Stephen Molnar said his council would have to ensure \"we get fair, equitable and sustainable treatment.\" \" (We) embrace the opportunity for a larger portion of our residents' federal and provincial tax dollars ... to assist in the investment in their own infrastructure,\" Molnar said. Woodstock Mayor Michael Harding was also cautious in his appraisal of the promised infrastructure money, saying the municipality would likely not receive the details for some time. Like Molnar, Harding hopes the substance of any new infrastructure funding programs would be devoid of any cumbersome provisions. \"Hopefully, they will follow very, very quickly and hopefully there isn't a lot of red tape,\" the mayor said. \"There appears to be a lot of negotiation going on in the background on how quickly the money will flow and what those amounts will be. Harding, though, was impressed with the provincial government's promise to provide more than $1 billion for a combination of social housing renovations and new affordable housing projects over the next two years. Harding, an advocate for affordable housing, applauded these \"additional supports\" for helping the province's most vulnerable. \"These are badly needed across the province and in Oxford,\" the Woodstock mayor said. \"As are the 4,500 affordable housing units that are coming, according to their math.\" Hardeman, though, did express concerns about the long-term impact of the overall government spending. While acknowledging the need for spending to stimulate the sluggish economy, he warned the $14.1-billion deficit represented by the 2009 budget would be the highest in the province's history. Oxford's political and business leaders were also positive about the provincial budget's promise to reduce both personal income and corporate income taxes. Starting in July 2010, Ontarians will receive a 16.5 per cent tax cut on the first $38,848 of taxable income while most businesses will enjoy a corporate tax decrease of 14.3 per cent to 18 per cent. While he approved these tax cuts, Hardeman said his party had advocated a similar policy for the past several years as a tool to encourage additional investment in Ontario. \"It's something our party has been telling them since 2003,\" Hardeman said. \"I'm just disappointed it took five years to find that answer.\" Harrison simply described the tax cuts as \"good long-term strategies for growth,\" saying the benefits wouldn't be fully realized for a few years. Molnar, while supportive of strategic tax cuts, wondered why these measures weren't being introduced a little sooner. Mentioning the promised \"rebates,\" including the one-time $1,000 cheque for eligible Ontario families, Molnar said these stimulus measures should be implemented in the short term. \"If it's about stimulus, that means money in the pocket,\" he said. \"Do it as son as possible. If you're cutting a cheque, cut it now.\"",

    "sentence": "Mom livid at unsafe length of child's bus ride. Tina Vehof consoles her youngest son Joshua, 4, as they walk up their rural laneway, his tears contrasting the boundless energy of his three older siblings running up ahead. The four children, bubbling with emotion, have just gotten off their school bus after a long day that started shortly before 7 a.m., when Tina woke them to get dressed for their bus to school some nine hours earlier. \"I got them to bed at a good time last night, but this is what happens,\" Vehof explained. Vehof is livid at the unsafe length of their morning bus ride and frustrated no one in either the busing consortium or the Catholic school board has responded to her concerns. This scene of wound, wired energy and frustration plays itself out almost daily as the kids arrive home from being cooped up on the bus and at school all day. Despite the 40-plus minutes they've just spent on the bus now, the children are picked up for the ride to school between 7:15 and 7:30 a.m. They don't arrive at Holy Family Catholic French Immersion School until almost 9 a.m., putting their morning bus commute well above the 70-minute maximum time in their school board's transportation policy. \"The children can't cope with these times,\" Tina Vehof said. \"I can see they're suffering because of it. They're always tired and their anxiety level is high.\" Vehof said the March break provided respite from this schedule and that in the few days after school resumed last week she again noticed her children's fatigue and anxiety levels rising. Vehof is upset her complaints to the London District Catholic School Board and its Southwestern Ontario Student Transportation Services consortium haven't been resolved. She said she has been following the proper complaint procedure, first approaching her children's principal, and then e-mailing a letter to the consortium. Her letter is one of five sent by families whose 11 children are on the route, with drop-offs at Holy Family, St. Michael's Catholic School and St. Mary's High School. \"Children simply cannot tolerate the extended hours on a bus,\" Vehof's letter read. \"There (have) been numerous incidents of unacceptable behaviour already reported (slashing bus seats, burning shoes on the bus and much more), done by the high school children. \"Children are tired, irritable and overall are not able to cope.\" One of the other letters explained how the route originates in Tavistock before picking up several students in the vicinity of the 16th Line of East Zorra-Tavistock and Oxford Road 5 -- the Vehofs live in this area -- before heading through Bright and onto Plattsville. St. Mary's students are dropped off first in Woodstock, followed by Holy Family students and lastly St. Michael's pupils. Student Transportation Services general manager Maureen Heath explained in an e-mail Monday she was aware of the concern with this bus route, attributing conditions on the route to the vast geography at play for the schools. She also confirmed an efficiency review led to the elimination of a bus route in the area. \"Vast geography in rural areas and program options relative to a student's location are constraints which sometimes make the 70-minute window impossible to achieve,\" Heath wrote in the e-mail. In a subsequent phone interview, Heath acknowledged many of the students bused to school in the district are rural, but there is still a variance between boards in interpreting what a 'normal' rural bus situation should look like. Vehof refuted any attempt to explain the long bus ride as simply a factor of living in a rural environment. She said and the other families have the right to send their children to a French immersion Catholic school and Holy Family is the only option. Even if she were to switch her children to St. Michael's for the English Catholic program, they would ride the same bus route and their transportation times would remain the same. Only in switching to the closest English public school -- Hickson Central Public School -- would the bus ride get shorter. Heath said it's possible conditions may improve next school year, as the consortium will be changing bus routes again with the goal of increasing the number of shared routes. \"I'm not in a position to make guarantees, but the intent is to go back through our routes -- particularly in areas we're aware of -- with a fresh set of eyes,\" Heath said.

    "sentence": "Will and grace. The wills and estate lawyer -- who has built his practice resolving inheritance disputes -- is opening up to help others learn from his front-row seat to squabbling siblings, wrenching relationships and fractured families. \"Anybody out there who is fighting with their family, that thinks that their life is so difficult, who hates their job -- you may change your life when you read stories like that and you realize what life is all about,\" Kotzer said from his Toronto office. In the book, Where There's an Inheritance: Stories From the World of Two Wills Lawyers (Continental Atlantic Publications), Kotzer shares the stories he says gave himself and co-author Barry Fisher a deeper appreciation for life. Given the recession, Kotzer's getting media attention from CNN to the New York Times for the practical advice gleaned from tales of greed, rage, anger, love and empathy. The University of Windsor Law graduate said he often sees people who are at the end of their life, who need to decide important details such as the fate of their family. One woman, Kotzer said, had terminal cancer and he had to ask her who would raise her seven-year-old daughter once she died. \"I can't give her up,\" she told Kotzer, and started to cry. She continued to weep in his office. \"Who's going to know the way I comb her hair? \"Who's going to know the way I read her stories and the way I pinch her nose?\" the mother asked desperately. The ordeal was even tough for Kotzer, who admits he often has to fight to hold back tears. That simple life lesson -- learning to appreciate what you've got -- is not uncommon in Kotzer's practice. He said one rainy, cold, windy day he had to meet a client in her car because she wasn't mobile enough to come into the office. It was the first time she left the hospital in a year and when Kotzer joined her in a car out front to discuss her will, her hand was out the window, collecting the raindrops that poured down. \"We looked at that day as two totally different things. To me it was frustration, work and aggravation, and to her it was probably the most beautiful day that she will see for the rest of her life.\" His latest book follows two others, The Family Fight: Planning To Avoid It, and The Family War: Winning the Inheritance Battle, written to help families understand the laws and documents that govern wills and inheritance. Special for Sun Media readers, if you buy the book before April 15 you will receive Family Fight, Planning to Avoid It, for free plus shipping. Kotzer also offers free will reviews in Ontario to make sure that a will is up to date and not a recipe for disaster. In some cases, the law is not enough to solve inheritance disputes, so Kotzer relies on another route. He is also a professional songwriter who writes to touch the hearts of people. \"To me, the most important thing is our family and I'm seeing it's being destroyed in front of me. I'm on a mission to save families through inheritance disputes,\" said Kotzer, who also delivers his message through song. One of his songs, Photos In A Drawer, is often played while he is doing radio shows. Sometimes people need to realize what is really important to them, he said. Kotzer also uses music as a vehicle to compensate for the constraints he feels while working with the law.

    "sentence": "Author to speak about Neches River. Richard Donovan, author of “Paddling the Wild Neches,” will be speaking in Athens on Monday at the monthly meeting of the East Texas Environmental Concerns Organization. One of Texas’ last wild rivers, the Neches forms the eastern boundary of Henderson County and meanders over 400 miles from northwest of Tyler to the Gulf of Mexico near Beaumont. The Neches and its bottomland forests are home to a variety of wildlife -- bald eagles, deer, squirrels, otters, wood ducks, mallards, wild turkeys, and colorful songbirds. The public is invited to this event. For hundreds of years the Neches River Valley has nourished a succession of peoples -- Caddo and Atakapa Indians, then Spanish, French, and Mexican explorers, next early “Texian” settlers, finally the Anglo-Americans who came in droves to the new state of Texas. The Neches sustains half a million people, meeting the needs of municipalities and industries. Along the way, the river nourishes the forests of the Neches River National Wildlife Refuge, the Davy Crockett National Forest with its Big Slough Wilderness and Neches Overlook, the Angelina National Forest with its Upland Island Wilderness, the popular Martin Dies Jr. State Park, the famed Big Thicket National Preserve, and thousands of acres of private land. In June 2006, the director of the U.S. Fish and wildlife service gave approval to the Neches River National Wildlife Refuge on a beautiful stretch of the upper Neches River in Anderson and Cherokee counties. With the donation of the first acre of land to the refuge the following August, the Refuge was officially established. Now the Texas water development board and the city of Dallas, who want to build a reservoir on the Refuge site, are suing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to try and overturn the Refuge. The 25,000 acres proposed for inclusion within the proposed refuge boundary contain some of the best remaining and least disturbed bottomland hardwood forest habitat left in Texas, rated as “Priority 1” by the USFWS. Adding land to the Neches River National Wildlife Refuge will protect vital habitat for wildlife, including waterfowl and migratory songbirds, provide wonderful hunting and other outdoor recreational opportunities for the public, and serve as an economic boon to surrounding communities. The 540 national wildlife refuges in the lower 48 states fueled more than $809 million in sales. With bird watching and canoeing the fastest-growing nature activities in the state, East Texas has much to gain from the Neches River National Wildlife Refuge. The monthly meeting of the East Texas Environmental Concerns Organization will be at 6 p.m. Monday at First Presbyterian Church in Athens. The meeting room is in the main building inside the back door.",

    "sentence": "Reward raised in murder case. The reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of a suspect in the June 2007 murder of a Tennessee Colony man has been upped to $5,000. On June 1, 2007, Melton Lewis Paris, 51, was found shot to death inside his residence at 341 CR 2701 between Tennessee Colony and Yard in northern Anderson County. Paris had been shot once in the head, according to Anderson County Sheriff Greg Taylor. On Wednesday, Taylor told the Herald-Press that the Anderson County Crimestoppers’ board of directors recently voted to increase the reward in Paris’ case from $1,000 to $5,000. There have been few solid leads in the case, the sheriff admitted. “Unfortunately, we don’t have anything new,” Taylor said Wednesday. “Occasionally, we’ll have somebody who thinks they have some knowledge of it, but nothing’s panned out so far. This $5,000 (reward) might help.” Anderson County Sheriff’s Capt. Tommy Barr is heading the investigation, with Sgt. Larry Warrick providing assistance, according to the sheriff. Authorities have said they were dispatched to Paris’ residence during the late afternoon hours of June 1, 2007 after a friend of the decedent reported coming to the man’s residence and discovering him laying on the floor in a puddle of blood. Around the time of the murder, Taylor told the Herald-Press that “the lifestyle of the deceased...tends to increase the possibility of a lot of suspects.” Anyone with possible information about the case should call Crimestoppers at (903) 729-TIPS (8477).",

    "sentence": "Fleeing suspect arrested. A 36-year-old Palestine man who successfully eluded authorities following a weekend traffic stop was arrested Wednesday at an Anderson County residence. James Ernest Barnett, 36, of Palestine was arrested without incident around 9:30 a.m. Wednesday at a residence on CR 367 off of U.S. 79, approximately 2 miles east of Palestine, according to Anderson County Sheriff Greg Taylor. The arrest was made after Anderson County Crimestoppers had received a tip from a private citizen concerning Barnett’s whereabouts. Taylor said he and about five other representatives of the Anderson County Sheriff’s Office “swooped in on” the house after receiving the tip. “He (Barnett) didn’t have a chance to run,” Taylor said. “We had him out of the house before he knew what happened.” Three other male subjects inside the residence were not arrested, the sheriff added. Late Sunday morning, Barnett led an Anderson County sheriff’s deputy on a high speed chase into Freestone County after he had been stopped in an “older model” Ford Explorer for “a non-visible registration sticker” inside the Palestine city limits, according to Taylor. After failing to provide proof of liability insurance, authorities have said Barnett declined the officer’s request to step out of his vehicle and then sped off -- first leading the officer on several city streets before heading out of town in a westwardly direction on U.S. 79. The driver took the U.S. 84 turnoff towards Fairfield before turning onto FM 489 and then onto Freestone County Road 360, according to the sheriff. Wright ultimately lost control of his squad car on the county road, with the suspect continuing approximately 2 more miles before abandoning his vehicle and fleeing on foot, according to Taylor. A Texas Parks & Wildlife Department game warden who had joined the pursuit attempted to apprehend the suspect, but lost him in the woods, the sheriff stated. At the time of Barnett’s arrest Wednesday morning, Taylor said a 1996 Chevrolet Z-71 pickup was parked in the driveway of the residence. The vehicle was reported stolen Sunday in Freestone County, approximately 2 miles from where the suspect abandoned the Ford Explorer, according to the sheriff. “Inside that truck in a cigarette package in the console was a small amount of methamphetamine that he claimed,” Taylor said. Barnett already had a “blue warrant” which reflects a parole violation, according to Taylor. Barnett was transported to the Anderson County Jail following his arrest and will be charged locally with evading arrest/detention with a motor vehicle and possession of a controlled substance less than 1 gram, the sheriff stated. The suspect also faces unauthorized use of a motor vehicle charges in Freestone County in relation to the stolen truck. --------- Paul Stone may be contacted via e-mail at pstone@palestineherald.com",

    "sentence": "Grand jury indicts man for fleeing traffic stop. A 24-year-old Elkhart man who allegedly fled from an officer during the course of a traffic stop this past September has been indicted by an Anderson County grand jury. William Lee Spafford III, 24, of Elkhart was indicted March 4 on the felony charge of evading arrest/detention with a vehicle, according to records released by the Anderson County district clerk’s office. Shortly after 9 p.m. on Sept. 21, Anderson County sheriff’s deputy Ronnie Howell attempted to make a stop on a 2001 Mercury Sabre for failure to yield the right of way, according to Anderson County Sheriff Greg Taylor. The vehicle’s driver, later identified as Spafford, turned on to CR 2202 — also known as Salt Works Road — and stopped in the general vicinity of the Westwood Elementary School, according to the sheriff. As the deputy was approaching the car, Spafford accelerated from the scene, with Howell giving pursuit, according to Taylor. Spafford drove at “unsafe speeds” at times during the ensuing pursuit of approximately eight miles until slamming on his brakes on FM 645 in the Tennessee Colony area, causing the deputy’s vehicle to strike the back of his Sabre, the sheriff stated. The suspect then exited his vehicle and fled on foot, but was subsequently apprehended by Howell following a short foot pursuit, according to Taylor. The sheriff said Spafford appeared “delusional” following his arrest, saying the Mexican MafiaÂ was “after him.” Â Other indictments recently handed down by the grand jury included: Joyce Glover, 22, Palestine, date of alleged offense, Nov. 23, 2008. Michael Smith, 49, Palestine, date of alleged offense, Dec. 18, 2008. Bruce James Hogue, 44, Palestine, date of alleged offense, Sept. 19, 2008.

    "sentence": "Dulcimer festival draws fans from across U.S.. It was all about dulcimers and music on Saturday during the second weekend of the Dogwood Trails Celebration. The Palestine Old Time Music & Dulcimer Festival was in high gear on Saturday at the Museum for East Texas Culture, the last full day of the three-day festival that brought people from all across the United States including Missouri, New York, North Carolina and Virginia to perform as well as participate. “It’s went really well — we’ve had a bigger crowd this year with lots of workshops and jammin’ sessions,” festival organizer Margaret Wright said. “We’ve had every kind of instrument — guitar, banjo, mandolin, hammer and mountain dulcimers, and fiddle.” More local people are starting to come out to the annual dulcimer festival, Wright said, joining the loyal dulcimer fans who helped put Palestine, Texas on the “map,” so to speak, in the dulcimer world. “We’ve had a lot of Old Time music followers come out. One man from Montana met up with a friend from Dallas and they are both big Old Time fans,” she said. Several classes and private lessons also were held. “We’ve fashioned the festival to meet the needs of those who attend,” Wright said. “If they arrived too late for the class they needed, then we would pull someone to give them a private lesson.” Voice lessons also were given by classic and Old Time music voice extraordinaire Alice Gerraurd, Wright said. “She’s known for her voice — her country style of singing, Carter Family style,” Wright said. “She is a master of harmony.” Wright, who organizes the dulcimer festival along with her husband Jerry, wanted to send out a special thank you to the museum staff and the volunteers. “We had a lot of volunteers from Crockett, Palestine and Houston,” Wright said.",

    "sentence": "Man gets two years in state jail facility for fleeing from police. Man gets two years in state jail facility for fleeing from police A 54-year-old Palestine man has been sentenced to the maximum two years in a state jail facility after pleading guilty to fleeing from Palestine police approximately 1 1/2 years ago. Gary Wilson, 54, of Palestine was sentenced to two years in a state jail facility Friday at the Anderson County Courthouse by 87th State District Judge Deborah Oakes Evans. In mid-January, Wilson had pled guilty to the state jail felony offense of evading arrest with a motor vehicle, stemming from an August 2007 incident during which he fled from local police after they had received a report of an intoxicated driver, according to Stanley Sokolowski, assistant district attorney for Anderson County. On Aug. 17, 2007, Palestine police say they received a call from a “concerned citizen” who reported that Wilson was intoxicated and operating a motor vehicle. After receiving the call, Palestine police officer Gary Rayford attempted to stop a 2001 Cadillac near the intersection of West Palestine Avenue and Delmar Street, according to Sokolowski. “The vehicle (which was operated by Wilson) refused to stop,” according to the assistant district attorney. The vehicle’s driver ran multiple stop signs and red lights and also traveled in the wrong lane of traffic at one point, he added. Wilson ultimately pulled into the driveway of a residence in the 1200 block of North John Street, according to Sokolowski. “He (Wilson) got out of the vehicle...he didn’t stop and they (officers) had to take him to the ground,” the assistant district attorney said. Officers believed Wilson to be intoxicated and discovered “at least two open containers” in his vehicle, Sokolowski said. Wilson already had an “extensive criminal history relating to DWIs” and also was sentenced to five years in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice on an arson conviction in the mid-1990s, according to Sokolowski. Wilson was sentenced Friday following a hearing of approximately 45 minutes. Although receiving the maximum state jail sentence, he was not assessed a fine. Some may portray the August 2007 incident as a “victimless crime” since no one was injured, but Sokolowski disagrees, saying innocent peoples’ lives are put at risk when an intoxicated driver flees from police and runs red lights and stop signs in the process. “My feeling is it’s one of the most dangerous things that can occur out there,” Sokolowski said. --------- Paul Stone may be contacted via e-mail at pstone@palestineherald.com",

(AP) — Pebody Energy says it is closing an eastern Illinois coal mine because geological conditions prevent its expansion. Peabody says the roughly 160 employees of the Vermilion Grove mine near Ridge Farm will be offered transfers to the company’s 13 other mines across the Midwest. Employees were told Thursday. Company spokeswoman Megan Gallagher says the coal that can be safely reached in the mine is gone. She says further expansion isn’t practical or safe because of local geology. The mine opened in 2002.

A few unexpected expenses might require the Crestwood Board of Education to amend their budget in May, Superintendent Lorraine Bailey informed the board Wednesday night during the regular meeting. Bailey explained if the budget is off by a certain percentage, law requires the budget be amended. Tuition to Paris High School was more than expected this year, which Bailey said was due to higher costs divided by fewer students. An additional teacher was also hired midyear. Despite the unexpected expenses, Bailey said the school has “done very well staying in line with what we budgeted.” During the meeting, board members also started looking at summer projects. The roof over the cafeteria and kitchen will be replaced as well as patch work to the rest of the roof with the bid being awarded to Martinsville Roofing at a cost of $38,117. The roof project was approved for Health/Life/Safety funds. The school is also in need of a new chair lift. The current lift is not operable at this time. The bid was awarded to Garaventa Lift, who originally installed the lift at the school. Bailey said the company is very reputable. The H/L/S amendment for the lift has not yet been approved, Bailey noted; however the preliminary paper work came back with no concerns. If the amendment is not approved, the money will come from the Operations and Maintenance Fund. Several years ago, the board looked into tuckpointing the school. The bids came back higher than anticipated and the board decided to hold off on the project. Now, the problem is getting worse and tuckpointing is inevitable. The project bid was awarded to Midwest Restoration of Paris in the amount of $12,680. The board also voted to replace to busses through Midwest Transit. The school will lease a two year old 65 passenger bus at a cost of $60,100 before trade-in at a value of $6,600; and another two-year-old 65 passenger bus at a cost of $59,700 before trade-in of $6,100. The school calendar was approved for next year and is the same calendar as District 95. The first day of school will be Aug. 17 and the final day of school, if no snow days are used, will be May 26. During the administrative report, Bailey reminded the board preschool and kindergarten screenings will be held March 17, 18 and 19 for all students in the district who will be 3 or 4 by Sept. 1 for preschool and for those who will be five by Sept. 1 for kindergarten. Anyone who has not yet made an appointment is encouraged to do so. Following an executive session, the board accepted the resignation of Ashley Nickles as girls basketball coach and hired Sarah Crippes as the replacement.",

    "sentence": "Shiloh pondering changes, part 1. HUME – A member delegation of the Shiloh School District Curriculum Committee met with the board of education Monday night to discuss the fate of Block 8 scheduling. Principal Mark Hettmansberger presented the main report and said the committee has serious misgivings about continuing with Block 8 for high school students. He noted current research is divided on the value of the scheduling system that uses double periods on alternating days to teach subject matter. According to Hettmansberger, the research indicates that Block 8 is most successful in schools that have student bodies composed of high achieving individuals from affluent backgrounds. It seems to be less viable in districts like Shiloh where more than 30 percent of the students have individualized learning plans and the free and reduced lunch count approaches 50 percent, indicating a significant poverty rate. “From the management standpoint, the block schedule is real easy,” said Hettmansberger. “It makes my life easier because we don’t have so many period changes during the day, but I don’t believe it’s best for our students.” Hettmansberger said the curriculum committee cast a unanimous vote to abandon Block 8 in favor of the more traditional eight-period day. The vote, however, was split when the faculty was provided the opportunity to express an opinion. Slightly more than half of the teachers favored the eight-period day, and the other half was divided between those wanting a modified Block 8 and those desiring to retain the present system. Other members of the curriculum committee spoke to the identified weaknesses of the Block 8 system. District technology coordinator Terry Sullivan said his perception is that Block 8 results in too much down time as the teachers commonly give students 15 to 20 minutes at the end of each double-period to start on assignments. “The idea being that responsible students will take advantage of that time,” said Sullivan, adding the reality is much different as he sees computer use and on-line access spike near the end of each period. Board member Dana Hales, a retired educator, questioned the validity of faulting Block 8 for the students using the end of the period time in unproductive ways. “That last 15-to-20-minute shut down is a teacher guidance issue,” said Hales. “They shouldn’t be getting on the computers to play.” Hettmansberger agreed, while pointing out that none of Shiloh’s teachers ever received training for using Block 8 effectively after it was adopted in the 1990s and new teachers graduating from college are not familiar with the approach either. “If we continue with it, I will be coming back to the board asking for money to do proper training,” said Hettmansberger. Math teacher Debra Akers said the length of the classes contributes to the students shutting down at end of the period. “When you get into algebra II and trigonometry and are trying to cover three-to-four classes (in the double period), the kids get glassy-eyed trying to learn five new things,” said Akers. “At the end of the lesson, the kids consider class over and put their books away.” Shiloh’s other math teacher, Corey White, added that current college teacher preparation classes are stressing the need to break material into smaller blocks for presentation in a more condensed time. He recounted participating in a recent college exercise that set a preferred time limit of 30 minutes for presenting the information. Guidance counselor Amber Grenda said the every-other-day approach in Block 8 is a real detriment to students who have difficulty retaining information. She said such students need the repetition of daily classes to avoid forgetting what they learn. “We’re kind of hoping this will help our lower level students remember,” said Grenda. “I’ve also heard from our higher achieving students that they don’t like the 20-minute-end-of-class which breaks down.” District superintendent Gary Lewis added switching to an eight-period day will reintroduce a study hall into the schedule – something not possible in the Block 8 system. According to Lewis, a dedicated study hall period may prove helpful as the district copes with the unfunded Response to Intervention (RTI) mandate requiring schools to take steps that provide early identification of when students are struggling in a class and then intervene to correct the problem before a student gets so far behind that an individual learning plan is needed. The superintendent foresees using the study hall period for helping students identified through RTI get back on track. Hettmansberger said switching to the eight-period day will require Shiloh High School students to take a minimum of seven classes per term to meet the school’s graduation requirement. He was not enthralled with offering a study hall to all students. “The administration will strongly push students to take eight classes,” said Hettmansberger. Board president Mike Means suggested that board members be prepared to decide the issue at the April meeting.",

HUME – Principal Mark Hettmansberger has concerns about Shiloh’s relationship with the Kansas Treatment and Learning Center (TLC) of the Eastern Illinois Area of Special Education. Hettmansberger advised board members that sending Shiloh students to TLC is expensive, yet there seems to be little in the way of positive results. Shiloh currently has four students attending the facility for youths with severe behavioral problems at a cost of $15,000 per student. “In the three years that I have been here, we haven’t had one student graduate from TLC,” said Hettmansberger. The principal stressed the failure of students to stay at TLC has an adverse impact on Shiloh’s graduation rate.",

Corbin. “Right now, we are in the process of drawing up arrest warrants for two persons,” Detective Jeff Goodwin of the Paris Police Department said shortly before 1 p.m. Tuesday. Goodwin said a Crime Stoppers tip led investigators to Ashley L. Evens, 26, of rural Paris and Guy C. Harminson, 26, also of rural Paris as suspects in the case. “We’ve been looking at them since March 14th,” said Goodwin. The detective added police believe the evidence gathered in the case will show that Evens was driving a 1996 Dodge pickup that struck Corbin at 1:33 a.m. on Dec. 6, 2008. Paris police and fire departments and the Edgar County Special Service Area Ambulance responded to the early morning call on Dec. 6 and found Corbin in the southbound lane of state Route 1 at the Marshall Street cutoff. He was first transported to Paris Community Hospital and subsequently airlifted to Carle Foundation Hospital, Urbana, where he succumbed to his injuries at 10:22 a.m. The warrant for Evens charges her with a Class 1 felony of leaving the scene of an accident involving a death and driving while license suspended. Harminson is being arrested on a Class 4 felony of obstructing justice. A check of Edgar County Court records through the judici website reveals that Evens has a prior speeding conviction in Edgar County. Harminson’s name does not appear in the records. Goodwin confirmed that both Evens and Harminson were interviewed by the police as part of the investigation, and he anticipated them surrendering on the warrants later Tuesday afternoon.",

Project coordinator David Dick attended Monday’s city council meeting to ask for support for the project. Dick said the project did not need monetary help for the project, but asked for involvement through planting and watering the trees. The goal is to plant 25 to 30 native shade trees, not ornamental trees, on the boulevards and street sides (not backyards) of private yards in the spring of 2009. In addition, Dick hopes have another 50 to 60 trees planted this fall and each fall thereafter. City grounds/maintenance supervisor Teresa Bach jumped at the chance to be a part of the project. Bach is also a Master Gardener, who are also helping with the project. The Edgar County Community Foundation agreed to be the custodians of the funds for the project, and also agreed to kick-start the project by funding the first 25 trees to be planted. Dick was inspired to begin the project by the plaque at Schwartz park that reads “The true meaning of life is to plant trees, under whose shade you do not expect to sit.” “[Trees] provide shade by moderating the radiant energy from the sun, they absorb carbon dioxide and other pollutants and give off oxygen in exchange. Who could ask for more?” Dick said during the city council meeting. To keep the project going, donations will be needed from the community. “Every tax deductible dollar will be used directly for the purchase of and planting of trees,” said Dick. Anyone who would like to contribute to the project should send donations to the Edgar County Community Foundation in care of Citizens National Bank in Paris. Funds should be earmarked for the Trees for Tomorrow Project. Anyone who would like to see if their property qualifies for tree planting is encouraged to contact the city. The Edgar County Community Foundation agreed to be the custodians for funds for the new Trees for Tomorrow (TFT) of Paris. The foundation is also funding the planting of the first 25 trees. Contributions from the public are necessary to keep the project going. Donations may be sent to the Edgar County Community Foundation in care of Citizens National Bank.

Corbin in a hit-and-run accident made her first court appearance Thursday morning. Ashley L. Evans, 26, of Paris, was in the custody of the Edgar County Sheriff’s Department for an appearance before Judge David W. Lewis. The purpose of the hearing was to advise Evans of the charge against her, explain her trial rights as a U.S. citizen and to address the issue of legal counsel. Evans is charged with a single Class 1 felony of leaving the scene of a motor vehicle accident that resulted in death and failing to report the accident to law enforcement. Lewis advised Evans that a penitentiary sentence of between four and 15 years is possible upon conviction. Probation is another sentencing option. While awaiting her turn before the bench, Evans often sat with her face in her hands. She spoke softly during the hearing and said little except to answer questions from the court, although she did say she will try to hire defense counsel. She was remanded back to custody on a $50,000 bond. Also appearing was Guy C. Harminson, 26, of Paris. Harminson is charged with a Class 4 felony of obstruction of justice, alleging he provided investigators with false information about the accident in order to prevent Evans’ arrest. Evans and Harminson share a rural Paris address. Harminson said he cannot afford legal counsel and public defender L. Kaye DeSelms was assigned to the case. He was remanded to custody on a $15,000 bond. Corbin died Dec. 6, 2008, at Carle Foundation Hospital in Urbana, approximately nine-hours after Paris emergency personnel found him lying in the southbound lane of state Route 1 at the Marshall Street cutoff.",

    "sentence": "Class has lesson on history, art. Paris and Henry County is rich in both history and art opportunities and the Lee Academy for the Arts is an example of how both are thriving here. The 2008-09 Leadership Henry County class had the opportunity to tour the Lee Academy building during its Wednesday session. Every time I visit Lee Academy, I am impressed by its beautiful hardwood floors and old-fashioned facade. The feet of thousands of youngsters have trod on those floors, and as we recently heard, the feet of little ones still grace the classrooms there where dancing, drama and music classes keep the school alive with artistic activity. The school also has a wide variety of youth and adult classes such as painting, pottery, photography, ballroom dancing, yoga and piano lessons. Ray Harding of the Lee School Association gave a presentation showing how far the school building has come since 2001 when the association formed a committee dedicated to preserving the school. These people who invested their hearts and souls into seeing the school brought back to its original glory were former students of the school and also people who had a love of Paris history. In 2002, a feasibility study was done to determine the best use for the building, and in 2003 the association decided to use the building for the arts. “We went about this in a pretty organized way,” said Harding. “Somebody suggested making luxury apartments out of the building, but we didn’t want to do that because it would ruin the flavor of the school.” The first two classrooms opened for use in 2004. Since then, the entire building has undergone renovation with several upstairs classrooms being rented out to local artists. The Lunchroom at Lee is the most recent exciting renovation to the building, which is a room with a kitchen, stage and audio system that can be rented for special events like dinners and receptions, performances and meetings. As Harding showed the class before and after pictures of the renovations, audible gasps could be heard because of the remarkable transformation of this historical house of learning. Lee Academy serves about 300 students a year and teachers are both paid and volunteer. The total cost of the renovation was $350,000; the debt remaining is about $43,000. Harding said the association hopes to receive more members who want to financially help the school, and also hopes the Lunchroom rentals will be able to help the school financially. “We have two hundred members, which is pretty good, and we appreciate all of them,” he said. More information about the school can be found on its Web site at . We also met with Stephanie Tayloe, county archivist, who showed us several interesting documents in the county archives located at the Central Community Service Center on Jones Bend Road Extended. Some of the documents there date back to almost 200 years ago. “The archives here are a hidden treasure of Henry County,” said Tayloe. “People do not realize the importance of these papers.” She has been involved with archiving the county records for about 12 years. “I love it and I hope I can do it for the rest of my life,” she said. The boxes and boxes of records previously were stored in the attic of the Henry County Courthouse where pigeons, mice and other varmints wreaked havoc on them for years. About 14 years ago, the process of cleaning and archiving the records began, and even though countless hours of work have been dedicated to the cause, there is still work to be done. “It’s been a labor of love,” said Tayloe. Linda Dunlap also works with the archives. “We work all of the time and it’s one hundred percent volunteer,” said Dunlap. The archivists transcribe the documents, type them up and file them on a computer and make books out of them — some of which can be purchased. Tayloe showed several documents which have historical significance and several boxes of estate settlements going back to the 1820s. “I’ve never met a Southerner yet who wasn’t done wrong by the will,” Tayloe said smiling. “They squabble over everything right down to the last iron skillet.” Earlier in the day the class also heard a presentation by David Webb, county historian; toured the Krider Performing Arts Center; toured the genealogy department at Rhea Public Library; heard a presentation by Mary Lodge, Paris-Henry County Arts Council director; and toured the Paris-Henry County Heritage Center with director Norma Steele (a.k.a. “Naughty Norma”). Art is imitating life and history is in the making in Henry County.",

    "sentence": "Meth makers leave behind toxic trail. CHATTANOOGA (AP) — Methamphetamine “cooks” are secretly converting hundreds of motel and hotel rooms into covert drug labs — leaving behind a toxic mess for unsuspecting customers and housekeeping crews. They are places where drug-makers can go unnoticed, mixing the chemicals needed for the highly addictive stimulant in a matter of hours before slipping out the next morning. The dangerous contaminants can lurk on countertops, carpets and bathtubs, and chemical odors that might be a warning clue to those who follow can be masked by tobacco smoke and other scents. Motels can be an attractive alternative for drug makers seeking to avoid a police raid on their own homes. “They can seize the trailer or seize your house but they can’t seize a motel room,” said Sullivan Smith, director of emergency services at Cookeville Regional Medical Center in north-central Tennessee. U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration records obtained by The Associated Press show that states reported finding evidence of drug-making in 1,789 motel and hotel rooms in the past five years — and that’s just those the authorities found. Some cleanup professionals hired to make the travelers’ havens livable again say most of their work is done on properties where a meth lab was discovered long after the fact. The number of clandestine labs that are never found is difficult to pin down. There was a slight uptick in hotel and motel lab busts reported to the DEA in 2008 from the previous year, with 149 in 2006, 87 in 2007 and 127 in 2008. The tally was 461 in 2005 and 965 in 2004, before there were restrictions on purchasing over-the-counter decongestants often used as ingredients. The DEA count is based on states that reported labs. The toxins can linger for days if meth lab hygienists wearing hazmat suits don’t clean living areas. The cleanups cost anywhere from $2,000 to $20,000. Even short-term exposure to vapors and residue where the drug is smoked or cooked can cause eye and skin irritation, vomiting, rashes, asthma problems and other respiratory issues. “It probably happens all the time,” said John Martyny, a National Jewish Medical and Research Center associate professor who is also an industrial hygienist and meth researcher. “The difficulty is, how do you make that attribution? You might think it is from cigarette smoking.” Martyny said health effects from long-term exposure to the drug making are not known because the clandestine labs did not become widespread until the 1990s. The volatile labs can be set up in less than four hours inside a hotel or motel room, according to The American Hotel and Lodging Association. Methods vary for making the drug, but the equipment can be simple enough to fit in a single backpack: A large soft drink bottle with some rubber tubing, duct tape, batteries, refrigerant packs and a decongestant that contains ephedrine or pseudoephedrine. Regardless of the complexity, “You are going to leave behind meth and caustic or potentially hazardous chemicals,” said Tommy Farmer, director of Tennessee’s Methamphetamine Task Force. “The smart ones come in about 10 o’clock at night and they make it all night and are out of there by 8 a.m,” said Joseph McInerney, president and CEO of the association. Environmental services specialist John Nale of Chattanooga, who is licensed to clean up meth labs, said tests he has conducted for buyers of motel properties have shown chemicals from clandestine labs that were never previously discovered and reported. Joe Mazzuca, operations manager at Meth Lab Cleanup Co. in Post Falls, Idaho, said he has tested pricey hotel rooms in Idaho and Utah and discovered contaminants where no one previously suspected a meth lab had been. “Seventy percent of the work the company does are properties that were never busted,” Mazzuca said. McInerney, the hotel and lodging association president, said few meth labs are set up in hotels compared with the industry renting about 3 million rooms a day. He said operators typically are vigilant about monitoring for any meth problems. In East Ridge, on Interstate 75 a few miles from Chattanooga, police last month uncovered one lab in the Cascade Motel. They posted a quarantine sign on the door of the room until the owner pays for a cleanup and the affected area is cleared for use. Police investigator Josh Creel said he and other officers located the chemicals, tubing and glassware that were being used when they made the arrests at the Cascade Motel. He advised the manager to leave the door and window open for several days in preparation for the cleanup, which involved replacing many of the furnishings. The motel manager, Pradip Patel, declined comment other than, “Our bad luck.”",

Kelsey Dunkerson, Lipscomb biology major and daughter of Mike and Betty Dunkerson of Paris, is one of 300 Lipscomb students who traveled to 23 locations around the globe to carry out mission work during spring break last week. Dunkerson traveled to Chicacao, Guatemala. The team mi nistered to the Quiche Indians on the coast and hosted daily medical clinics in rural villages. Annual spring break mission trips, largely coordinated and carried out by students, are one of the various projects that earned Lipscomb University in Nashville a spot on the President’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll With Distinction in 2009, a group of just 83 universities around the nation who have met the criteria for this national honor. Mission teams do everything from working with a Boys and Girls Club and conducting a vacation Bible school, to manual labor projects for Habitat for Humanity and providing food and medical supplies, all the while outreaching and evangelizing. This year’s participants traveled to 12 countries, including Honduras, El Salvador, Canada and Guatemala — and five states within the United States. Twelve more missions trips are in the works for summer, involving more than 500 students in benevolent mission work in the 2008-09 school year.",

According to a report by PPD Patrolman Jeramye Whitaker, McDaniel allegedly had inappropriate sexual contact with a girl less than 8 years of age Sunday. McDaniel’s bond was set at $100,000 and he is scheduled to appear Tuesday in Henry County General Sessions Court. In other incidents: More information has been released on the Wednesday arrest of a Paris woman for child abuse and neglect, as was originally reported in Thursday’s Post-Intelligencer. According to a report by PPD Patrolman Jamie James, Katrina L. Chappell, 24, of 1199 N. Poplar St., allegedly left her baby inside a vehicle at a Mineral Wells Avenue store for approximately 45 minutes while she was inside shopping. Witnesses said they noticed the baby in the vehicle when they went inside the store. They came out of the store 20 minutes later and the baby had not been moved. Chappell told police that she forgot the baby was with her. The windows had been up and the doors were unlocked, but the baby’s vital signs were all normal. Chappell was arrested with a bond of $2,500, and she was originally scheduled to appear Thursday in General Sessions Court. Money was stolen from a woman’s purse Thursday night or Friday morning as it sat inside an unlocked truck at her Clearview Drive home east of Whitlock. According to a report by Henry County Sheriff’s Department Deputy Wayne Fuqua, dogs were heard barking at the residence Thursday night. When the residents awoke Friday, they found the purse on the ground outside with $150 in cash missing from it. Nothing else appeared to be missing. Approximately $100 in cash was stolen during a burglary of Ridgeway Funeral Home, 201 Dunlap St. in Paris, Thursday night or Friday morning. According to a report by Whitaker, money was taken from two different unlocked cash drawers inside the funeral home and two filing cabinets also had been opened. The theft occurred sometime between 9 p.m. Thursday and 8:30 a.m. Friday. There were no signs of forced entry and all doors and windows were locked. A Paris woman was arrested at her residence Friday night for filing a false report and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.

The new 14-unit apartment building was built for low-income people with disabilities who meet certain criteria. The association started accepting applications for the units in September and about 12 people are on a waiting list for an apartment, Mr. Lynch said. He said there are plans to build another similar apartment building next door to Fithian House. The association probably will apply for Housing and Urban Development financing this summer, he added. Mr. Lynch said the need for another apartment building is clear given the success of Fithian House. The one-bedroom units have kitchens and bathrooms. Even though 24-hour on-site care is not available, residents have access to staff working just yards away at the Gatehouse, a transitional-living facility, where 11 people with disabilities can live for up to two years, learning life and job skills so they can live independently. The association paid for Fithian House with a $2.1 million HUD grant and $350,000 from the Allegheny County Multi-Housing Division, with the remaining amount contributed by the association. The Fithian House took about three years from concept to completion, Mr. Lynch said. The man for whom the building is named volunteered regularly at The Woodlands and was on the board of directors for The Woodlands and the Spina Bifida Association of Western Pennsylvania. Mr. Fithian died in September. Although the apartment building is full, work continues, Ms. Uriss-Spehar said. Before the end of the month, surveyors will look over land that the Woodlands wants to make into a 6-foot-wide accessible and graded trail leading from Fithian House to the main campus, Ms. Uriss-Spehar said. The trail, which is expected to be done by fall, will be for both Fithian House and Gatehouse residents, she added. The Woodlands also is coordinating a volunteer day when FedEx Ground employees will take Fithian House residents shopping to outfit their apartments. At the same time, other FedEx employees will shop to equip the apartment building's common kitchen, while others will shop for food and cook dinner. At the end of the day, the employees and residents will sit down and eat the meal together, Ms. Uriss-Spehar said. \"Our mission is to enrich the lives of people with disabilities, and partnering with FedEx Ground to help the new residents of Fithian House is a fun and unique way for us to do this,\" Ms. Uriss-Spehar said. \"Our staff, as well as the volunteers, are really looking forward to it.\" Applications from those who want to live at Fithian House are screened by a committee using HUD guidelines. Ms. Uriss-Spehar said the process is anonymous so no one gets special preference. Information on the application process is available at the association's Web site www.sbawp.org or by calling 724-934-9600.",

A Crafton man is suing WPXI-TV over a broadcast story that he claims used his photo when the story was about another man with the same last name. The story, broadcast Sept. 28, was about a South Fayette teacher and coach who resigned last year over what the school district called \"inappropriate\" e-mails that landed in the hands of other personnel and citizens in the district. The plaintiff, Nicholas A. Schepis, filed suit in Allegheny County Court against WPXI, its local cable affiliate, PCNC, and their parent company, Cox Enterprises Inc. of Atlanta. \"Prior to the release of the broadcast, defendants took not even the most basic of action to inquire into the accuracy of their linking of the photograph of plaintiff to the allegations of criminal conduct on the part of Peter C. Schepis Jr.,\" the suit said. Peter Schepis is the former substitute teacher and middle school football coach who resigned after the e-mail message, which included text and a nude photo, got the district's attention. The suit charges the television station with defamation, negligence and invasion of privacy. The station's General Manager Ray Carter declined to say how the mix-up occurred. \"As soon as we were made aware of the issue, we immediately stopped airing the photo and we issued a correction,\" Mr. Carter said. \"We believe we responded quickly and appropriately.\"",

    "sentence": "Developer granted delay for North Shore projects. The city's Stadium Authority board unanimously agreed yesterday with a Columbus developer's request to extend construction deadlines for North Shore hotel and amphitheater projects, though the request provoked warnings from board members. Continental Real Estate won approvals yesterday to push back construction starting dates for a $25 million Hyatt Place hotel until June 30 and a $12 million entertainment complex until Aug. 1. Under previous agreements with the authority, which controls the city-owned land between the North Shore stadiums, the developers were supposed to begin building next month. They requested more time to secure financing and government approvals for the projects, authority staffers said. Representatives from a union-backed neighborhood group called North Side United -- which has been trying to negotiate a community benefits agreement with Continental -- criticized the city agency for repeatedly siding with the developers. North Side United and Continental have not met since May 2008, organizers said. \"You're not acting in the public's interest -- you're acting in their interest,\" complained John Canning of the Central North Side. Though the board voted 5-0 to approve Continental's contract extensions, board members signaled some frustration and questioned whether the developers could finish the entertainment complex as promised by May 1, 2010. \"If this [approval] is given, we expect them to complete by the date we agreed to,\" state Rep. Jake Wheatley said. Continental \"better get on the stick, because we're kind of running out of patience. This is getting a little old for us,\" said the board's vice chair, Robert Ewanco. Stadium Authority Director Mary Conturo said it is possible for the developers to complete the amphitheater project in the nine months projected, from August to May 1, 2010. \"It's a tight schedule of course, but could be done,\" she said. Poor credit markets have affected the project, Continental Chairman Frank Kass told the Post-Gazette this week, and financing for the entertainment complex was impacted when Gov. Ed Rendell cut a proposed state grant from $4 million to $2.5 million. Mr. Kass said the outdoor construction of the amphitheater complex might be done by May 2010 but doubted the entire venue could.",

A house fire in Scottdale was put out so quickly yesterday that fire Chief L. \"Buzz\" Myers and other firefighters did not expect any victims until they found the body of an elderly homeowner in the basement. The body of James Marth Sr., 84, was found in a space beneath the first-floor kitchen. He had been lying near where the blaze started sometime before 11 a.m. One neighbor said Mr. Marth's son, who was at work when he was notified of the fire at the Broadway Street house he shared with his father, had been hopeful as he rushed to the scene. His father had been a fixture on the bicycle trail that runs through Scottdale. \"He spent all of his time on the bike trail,\" Chief Myers said. The fire chief said he would not have been surprised if Mr. Marsh Sr. was not at home when the fire started. Because of dense fog that lingered into the late morning yesterday, many residents in the vicinity of the Marsh home reported that they smelled smoke, but none reported the fire until the smoke plumes became more visible. The house, in the 400 block of Broadway, sits across the street and the railroad tracks from the town's municipal building and a stone's throw from the local ambulance and police stations. Within five minutes of arriving, firefighters had searched the upstairs bedrooms while hoses doused the flames. The fire nearly was out when they found Mr. Marth in the basement, the chief said. The cause of the fire does not appear to have been suspicious, though a state police fire marshal was at the scene investigating.",

    "sentence": "Passover traditions spread through market. The hauntingly joyous strains of klezmer music from the Ortner-Roberts Duo filled the Shadyside Giant Eagle Market District yesterday afternoon, guiding Jewish shoppers to an area where they could get all of their Passover questions answered, pick up recipes and a free box of matzo. Volunteers in \"Got matzah?\" T-shirts handed children bags containing kits to make a colorful matzo covers for the Passover Seder meal, and games such as a Hebrew word search. Allison Grodin of Squirrel Hill brought her four young children because she wanted them to get excited about the upcoming holiday. Her eldest, Harrison, 8, held a paper plate with four small cups containing symbolic foods. \"It's a seder plate. I think this is neat,\" he said, pointing out the haroset -- a sweet mixture of nuts and fruit -- bitter herbs, greens and matzo. Eighteen Jewish organizations partnered with Giant Eagle at the Market Districts in Shadyside and Bethel Park for the third annual Passover in the Aisles. The eight-day holiday begins at sundown April 8. Jewish families will share a ritual meal that tells the story of the ancient Israelites' flight from slavery in Egypt. One of the most important rules is that, because the Israelites had no time to allow bread to rise, only unleavened bread -- matzo -- may be eaten during Passover. To ensure this, Jews traditionally rid their homes of anything containing yeast or other ingredients that rise when cooked. Beer, pasta and beans are all out. Rabbi Sharyn Henry, associate rabbi at Rodef Shalom Congregation in Oakland, fielded a question about whether soy sauce is kosher for Passover. It's not, \"because soy sauce has wheat in it,\" she said. The Reform rabbi stood near an \"Ask the Rabbi\" sign, along with rabbis from other traditions. Orthodox Rabbi Daniel Wasserman of Shaare Torah Congregation, Squirrel Hill, said that people often stop him in the supermarket to ask questions about what's kosher, especially at Passover. \"People get very nervous, and rightly so, because everything is different,\" he said. While correct observance is important, so is fun, he said. The Seder, which includes games such as hiding a piece of matzo, is intended to interest adults and children alike. \"At our seder there are very deep, intellectual discussions, but we also throw marshmallows to represent the plague of hail,\" he said, referring to one of 10 plagues that the Bible says God brought on the Egyptians. Passover in the Aisles began three years ago as an outreach to Jews who weren't involved with Jewish communal life. But it has other benefits, said Jeff Finkelstein, president and CEO of the United Jewish Federation, which initiated the project. \"It shows pride in being Jewish that we do something like this publicly,\" he said. \"And it brings together a wide variety of Jewish organizations. Some of the participants have very different beliefs than others, but they have all come together for this as a community. This is a way of showing that we have more in common than not in common.\" Rabbi Mordy Rudolph of Chabad-Shadyside belongs to a movement that is highly traditional, but he enjoys working alongside Reform rabbis. \"There are very few cities where the entire Jewish community can come together like this,\" he said. As he spoke, chefs in the Market District kitchen demonstrated Passover recipes. Tammy Berkowitz, owner of Sweet Tammy's kosher bakery in Squirrel Hill, prepared coconut macaroons, a Passover favorite. Although her bakery also makes a flourless chocolate cake, it closes for the eight-day holiday because she has no way to remove every trace of flour, yeast and other forbidden foods. Her macaroons are dipped in Passover chocolate, which contains no corn products because \"corn grows when you cook it,\" she said. Clarice Horne of Shadyside, has favorite Passover recipes that she has used for decades, including a matzo kugel -- a sweet casserole-like dish that is ordinarily made with noodles. \"But you can always try something new,\" she said as she picked up a free recipe booklet. \"It's fun to cook for Passover.\" Irv Younger, center, of Or L'Simcha, and Joe Jolson, right, of Beth Shalom Congregation, restock free matzo samples as fast as shoppers snapped them up at the Giant Eagle Market District store yesterday in Shadyside.",

    "sentence": "A poodle perches atop the dog show pedestal. Standard poodle Hillwood Dassin De-Lovely took the winner's stage and posed regally for her victory photo after capturing the Best in Show award at yesterday's session of the Western Pennsylvania Kennel Association Dog Show. It makes sense that the pose would come naturally to the 3-year-old poodle who answers to the name \"Sissy,\" since it was the 13th best in show award she's garnered in the past year. \"It's very exciting every single time\" said Joseph Vergnetti, of Medina, Ohio, Sissy's handler and one of her owners. \"Today there were at least 1,000 dogs here and we beat out all of the others.\" Sissy competed in Saturday's session of the show, held at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, but didn't make it to the final round. On Saturday, she took third place in her group, non-sporting breeds. To make it to the final round, a dog must place first in its group. Saturday's best in show went to an Airedale terrier, Stirling Cool Hand Luke. The best in show award came with a Waterford bowl, $100 and a ribbon. Over the course of the two-day event, about 2,500 dogs competed in the show, said Nance Shields, president of the Western Pennsylvania Kennel Association. While it came down to one top dog on the winner's stage by the end of the afternoon on Saturday and Sunday, the convention center hall was a whirl of activity in the morning and early afternoon as the owners and handlers of more the more than 1,000 dogs prepared them for competition. There was primping and brushing and teasing in all corners of the convention hall in preparation for contests what would give the dogs just a few minutes to strut their stuff. It's a familiar scene for many of the owners and handlers who spend their weekends traveling from dog show to dog show. Amy Booth, of Fowlerville, Mich., said she and her husband, Phil, will attend 150 to 180 dog shows this year. They traveled to this weekend's show in a box truck which they use to transport their dogs and all of the equipment needed for their travel and showing. They were able to get a hotel room that would permit their dogs at the Downtown Westin. When the weather gets warmer, the Booths and their dogs will travel to shows in their camper. One of the dogs the Booths entered into the competition yesterday was Ms. Booth's 2-year-old smooth fox terrier, Dodger. Even though he is a short-haired dog, Dodger's preparation included mousse and gel and powder to make his coat look good. It paid off -- Dodger was chosen as best in his breed and then placed second in the terrier group. \"I personally do it because I love the dogs. There is nothing better than traveling some place in the country and taking the dog with you and experiencing it with them,\" said Ms. Booth, a full-time breeder and dog handler. Kris Goodman of Hudson, Ohio, brought her Pyrenean shepherd, Conor, to yesterday's competition. \"He got beat, but that's OK,\" said Ms. Goodman, an industrial engineer for General Motors who said she travels to 30 to 50 dog shows a year. Ms. Goodman travels to many of the shows with her friend, Karen Mlynar, of Akron, Ohio. They transport their dogs and equipment in the back of a minivan. \"You do it because you love to do it. You love showing the dogs and the thrill of the win if you get it,\" she said. \"It's an addiction. I did it for 30 years,\" said Joy Kealy, publicity chairperson for the Western Pennsylvania Kennel Association. \"You are just so proud of your dog and you like to go out and meet up with your friends and have a nice weekend.\" Mary Brazytis, of Cleveland, brought her rescue dog, an English cocker spaniel named Moose, to compete in the obedience portion of the show. Moose started to compete about four years ago after a trainer told Ms. Brazytis that her dog \"would never amount to anything\" because he performed poorly in obedience class. \"I wanted to prove her wrong and show her that Moose could do something,\" she said, adding that Moose has also completed training to be a therapy dog. Julia Kinsey, of Canton, Ohio, was preparing her two white standard poodles -- Vegas and Trouble -- for their trip home yesterday after both were eliminated from the final rounds of the competition. The process, which included brushing the hairspray and other products from their puffy fur and wrapping their ears in plastic, took almost as long as preparing them for competition. Ms. Kinsey said she attends dog shows nearly every weekend and has done so for the past eight to 10 years. \"I spend way more time on their hair than I do on mine,\" she said.

An 80-year-old man died yesterday in the parking lot of a Westmoreland County Italian grocery store when a car driven by an 82-year-old woman backed out of handicapped parking space and ran him over. The accident happened in the parking lot at DeLallo Italian Marketplace along Route 30 in Hempfield. The man, whom police did not immediately identify pending notification of relatives, was pronounced dead at the scene of accident, which was reported at 9:38 a.m. State police said the driver, Theresa Pilkington of Jeannette, was taken to Westmoreland Hospital after growing distraught after the accident. \"She's not injured but she is emotionally shaken up,\" Westmoreland County Deputy Coroner Gerry Fritz said. While backing up her car to leave the parking lot, she told police, she spotted a man in her review mirror who was approaching the store entrance. She said she applied the brakes but then stepped on the accelerator again when she no longer could see him behind her vehicle. Her car plowed through three concrete planters before clipping the poles holding up an entranceway awning, causing it to collapse onto her car. At some point, she hit the man, trapping him under the car. Emergency crews had to use jacks to support the damaged awning to prevent further collapse as they worked to free the victim from underneath the car. DeLallo's remained open yesterday, although customers had to use a rear entrance.",

David Eggert Associated Press March 23, 2009 From Lansing State Journal Lansing Board of Water & Light's commissioners may vote on a 2.5 percent rate increase at their meeting at 5:30 p.m. Thursday. It will be held at the BWL boardroom, 1232 Haco Drive. Last spring, the BWL's electric and water customers began paying 7 percent more. Steam customers had a 6 percent increase. - Lansing State Journal Detroit Edison and Consumers Energy distribute power to nearly 90 percent of Michigan's electric customers. The companies are seeking rate increases. Consumers Energy said its average residential power customer pays $89 a month. The bill would rise to $99, an 11 percent increase, under the company's proposal. Edison said a residential customer using 500 kilowatt hours a month pays $63. The bill would increase to about $70, an 11 percent increase, under the company's plan. Under a new state law, Consumers Energy could automatically implement its rate hike - or a lesser rate hike - in May if state regulators do not rule by then. Edison could do the same in July. Customers could get refunds, however, if the Michigan Public Service Commission later decides the increases are too high. Both utilities say they will make a decision on how to proceed as they get closer to the dates they can raise rates on their own - six months after a proposal is submitted. \"I think it is crummy in this time of hardship,\" said Bonnie Banks, 61, a retired court recorder who splits her time between Ann Arbor and Oscoda and is a power customer of both Consumers Energy and Edison. \"Because of the economy and all the layoffs and our high unemployment rate, it seems like there would be an even larger hardship for people.\"",

It was one of seven, mostly minor wrecks involving vehicles of the executive-protection unit since it was established in 2005, according to police records released under a Virginia Freedom of Information Act request. The Charles City crash occurred Oct. 16 at Route 5 and Adkins Road, about 12 miles northwest of Wilder's estate on the James River. Wilder lived there before he moved back to Richmond to meet residency requirements to be mayor. Assessment records show he still owns the property. Of the seven wrecks, city officers were blamed for three but charged in none, according to police reports and Charles City Sheriff Javier J. Smith. Other drivers were faulted in three wrecks and charged in at least two. One driver was cited with an improper lane change and another with failure to yield and driving without a license. Typically, city police officers aren't charged in minor wrecks because \"internal discipline procedures generally carry greater consequences to the officers than the citation would,\" Victoria N. Pearson, general counsel for the police department, said in an e-mail. \"Additionally, all of our accidents are reviewed by a review board, which includes citizens who participate in the process of determining appropriate discipline.\" Citing confidential personnel issues, Pearson would not say whether any officers had been disciplined. The accident reports describe officers' vehicles bumping into the back of one car, sideswiping another, and hitting the bumper of yet another. Except for the one in Charles City, all the wrecks occurred in Richmond. Damage estimates ranged from $50 to $4,000 per incident and more than $12,000 overall. The most expensive wreck caused by a city officer cost $1,822, according to the police department. The wrecks happened from June 2005 to October 2008, before Dwight C. Jones took office in January and ordered cuts of at least 50 percents to the unit's staff and fleet. The wreck in Charles City wasn't significant enough to warrant a full report, and no charges were filed, Sheriff Smith said. Two Richmond officers were in the vehicle at the time, he said.",

They were met on the curb by two security guards, and one protester read a letter detailing the financial struggles that many Connecticut residents have faced.

Ken Cuccinelli, R-Fairfax, attached the proposal onto a bill that also adds plates honoring the Washington Capitals, the Blue Ridge Parkway and others to the 200 specialty plates the Department of Motor Vehicles already offers. Under law, more than 350 people must sign up for a plate before DMV can produce it. Cuccinelli said 450 people have prepaid for the plate.

    "sentence": "Meteor or piece of spacecraft caused fireball, boom, expert says. A fireball and big boom that people witnessed Sunday night could have been caused by a meteor or even a falling part from a Russian spacecraft, experts say. \"I know it's one of the two,\" said Geoff Chester, an astronomer and public relations officer with the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington. \"I just can't tell you definitively which one it actually was.\" People in parts of Virginia, Maryland and North Carolina reported a light similar to fireworks about 9:40 p.m., followed by an explosive sound. Chester suggested that a falling Russian booster rocket caused the hubbub. The booster -- a steel cylinder about 25 feet long and 8 feet wide -- was part of the Soyuz spacecraft that launched Thursday on a mission to the International Space Station. The booster was expected to fall toward Earth on a path, headed east, that would have taken it across the Chesapeake Bay region Sunday night, Chester said. The booster would have burned in the friction of the Earth's atmosphere and, as it slowed below the speed of sound, it would have released energy that caused a sonic boom, Chester said. \"My feeling is this is what people actually saw,\" Chester said. Stefan Bocchino, a spokesman for the Joint Space Operations Center at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, said experts there do not think the light was caused by a manmade object. The Joint Space Operations Center tracks manmade objects that enter the atmosphere. The National Weather Service has ruled out any weather-related cause. Other experts said the light and boom sound like the work of a meteor. Meteors are bits of space rock or gravel that burn and create light when they hit the atmosphere. \"Some very bright ones are known to explode,\" creating a sound, said Phillip Ianna, a professor emeritus of astronomy at the University of Virginia. Meteors typically burn up in the atmosphere. Much less often, a small piece of the rock will hit Earth. Steve Chesley, an astronomer with NASA, said the Sunday phenomenon could be the work of a meteor the size of a television set or small car. \"These kinds of things hit the [atmosphere] once a month,\" Chesley said. They usually fall over water or less-populated areas and attract less attention. NASA doesn't track such small objects, Chesley said, and focuses instead on big ones -- space rocks half the length of a football field or more -- that are headed toward Earth. \"It's the big ones we're worried about, and we need to find them decades in advance,\" Chesley said. The object on Sunday had to be unusually bright to be seen in urban areas, where artificial lights drown out most celestial objects, said David Hagan, a staff scientist with the Science Museum of Virginia. \"It had to be quite a phenomenon to be observed from Shockoe Bottom,\" Hagan said. Brian Munford, 43, of Richmond, was driving in Short Pump when he saw the light. \"It was like a Roman candle headed the wrong way, coming down. . . . It was pretty cool-looking.\" Chester, of the Naval Observatory, said objects burning in the sky can appear deceptively close when they actually are many miles away.",

MANASSAS -- A Woodbridge man charged in the abduction and death of an Alexandria woman has been declared incompetent to stand trial and is awaiting treatment at a state mental-health hospital. Keith Baskerville -- the only survivor in the Sept. 13 event -- is charged with felony murder, abduction and carjacking charges in the death of 60-year-old Barbara Bosworth. This month, a judge in Prince William County Circuit Court declared Baskerville incompetent to stand trial and ordered him sent to Western State Hospital for treatment. Baskerville appeared in court Friday, when a judge was scheduled to review his case. But his review was continued after attorneys and the judge said Baskerville had not yet received the mental-health treatment ordered by the court. Baskerville is now due back in court April 24, when a judge will review his competency. Police said Baskerville and another man, 19-year-old Lutchman Chandler, abducted Bosworth from Springfield Mall in September and drove her to a PDQ Mart in Woodbridge, where they tried to use her ATM card to withdraw money. The men then left the store with Bosworth and crashed their car while fleeing the area. Chandler, who police said was driving the car at the time of the wreck, later died from his injuries. Judge Mary Grace O'Brien of Prince William Circuit Court said Baskerville's mental-health treatment had been delayed because she ordered him sent to Western State Hospital, though because of the nature of the crimes he is charged with, state laws require that he be sent to Central State Hospital. He had not been sent there before his court appearance Friday because of a lack of bed space at the hospital, O'Brien said. \"I don't want this case to fall through the cracks,\" O'Brien said before setting the April 24 court date.",

    "sentence": "York County man pleads guilty in attempted robbery; two others sentenced. Derek D. Moore, a key figure in a plan hatched by York County high school friends last year to rob a notorious drug dealer, is getting a taste of life behind bars. Judge Thomas B. Hoover of New Kent County Circuit Court revoked bond and sent the former Bruton High School student to jail yesterday after Moore pleaded guilty in the case and then tested positive for marijuana. Also, two other defendants in the case were sentenced yesterday. Out on bond since shortly after his arrest in October, Moore, 19, told the judge at first that he was clean, but after testing positive, offered that he may have picked up marijuana in his system from being with friends. That excuse reverberates through a case that ended with the shooting death of another Bruton student, Christopher Greene, in the Oct. 14 effort to rob John Steven Carter of drugs and guns at Carter's Lanexa home. Carter, 56, was using an alias and was on the run from drug charges in Florida; he apparently gunned down Greene as Greene broke through Carter's back door with a rifle, according to court documents. Carter disappeared but was arrested this month in Alabama after a monthslong search. He is facing drug, weapon and fugitive charges in Florida; it is uncertain whether he will be extradited back to Virginia. Moore, who helped arrange the plan to rob Carter and who drove to Lanexa on Oct. 14 with three other current or former Bruton students, lost his freedom yesterday and will be formally sentenced June 8. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit robbery and attempted robbery; sentencing guidelines indicate he'll serve seven to 20 months in jail. Moore was best friends with Greene and came forward to police the day after Greene's death. \"What we know about this case comes from Mr. Moore,\" Commonwealth's Attorney C. Linwood Gregory told Hoover. Two other defendants in the case pleaded guilty yesterday to misdemeanor charges of being accessories to conspiracy and to attempted robbery. Robert T. Tynes Jr., described in a batch of letters of support as an outstanding young man with a limitless future, received a suspended 24-month sentence. Tynes accompanied others to Lanexa and drove the vehicle home that carried the young men, leaving Greene's body behind outside Carter's back door. A third defendant, Kodie L. Tyler, who passed up bond and has been in jail since October, received a 10-year sentence, with all but six months suspended. He pleaded guilty to felony conspiracy to commit grand larceny. The drug den operated by Carter housed a secret marijuana growing operation. Two 18-year-old acquaintances of Moore set the robbery in motion by telling him about Carter; Robert M. Perez drove Moore and Greene to Lanexa to check out the house the day before the robbery attempt. John W. Chaffin and Perez told Moore he could find \"pillowcases full\" of dope at Carter's, and a deal was struck to share proceeds of the heist. This month, Chaffin and Perez pleaded guilty to attempted petit larceny. Perez received a suspended 12-month sentence and Chaffin is serving six months. Chaffin was sent directly to jail after testing positive for cocaine.",

    "sentence": "Huckabee campaigns with McDonnell in Roanoke. ROANOKE -- Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee campaigned with Virginia gubernatorial candidate Bob McDonnell in Roanoke yesterday, helping him raise $50,000 and praising him as the Republican who can help restore the party's fortunes nationwide. Speaking to reporters, Huckabee, who lost to Arizona Sen. John McCain last year in his bid to win the Republican nomination for president, criticized those who say \"that the Republican Party has sort of already experienced its demise and that the funeral services are being planned in the near future.\" \"You come to places like Virginia and you see that with Bob McDonnell, we've got a very strong pulse,\" Huckabee said at the Shenandoah Club downtown. \"Cancel the memorial.\" McDonnell, who resigned as state attorney general to run for governor, opened his campaign Saturday by promising to create jobs and make Virginia a leading energy producer. McDonnell favors drilling for oil and gas off Virginia's shore and says he wants to cut red tape to make it easier to start a business in the state. State Democratic Party leaders responded to McDonnell's campaign kickoff by labeling him an obstructionist who is unable to work across party lines to carry out the business of Virginia. The lone Republican in the race for the governor's job, McDonnell is counting on Huckabee to help him raise cash for the impending battle with the winner of the Democratic nomination. Three candidates are running for the Democratic nod: former Democratic National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe of McLean, former Del. Brian J. Moran of Alexandria and state Sen. R. Creigh Deeds of Bath County.",

The school said Saturday that about 28 percent of the eligible student population voted.

Collection of the new student fee wouldn't begin until the $36 million arena is finished in late 2011.

(AP)  The Indiana Department of Natural Resources is cracking down on out-of-state boaters who do not pay Indiana excise taxes. More than 300 people with boats moored in Hammond and East Chicago have been fined for failing to pay the tax. As many as 89 people could face fines of $500 and have their driver's licenses suspended for not acting on the tickets. Out-of-state residents can register their boats in their home state, but must pay Indiana excise taxes if they boat in Indiana. The recent crackdown was prompted in part by complaints by angry Indiana residents who pay the state's excise tax when they register their boats. ``These people felt they were being cheated,'' said DNR Lt. Jerry Shepherd. At the large Hammond Marina, about 85 percent of boaters live outside of Indiana. Port Authority Director Milan Kruszynski said ticketed boaters weren't happy, especially since they have to travel to Lowell Town Court if they want to contest the ticket. Of the more than 300 boaters cited in Hammond and East Chicago, between 150 and 200 refused to comply, contested or did not respond to the notice, said DNR Public Information Officer Shawn Brown. The Indiana General Assembly passed a law in 2006 to allow greater enforcement of the state's excise tax. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources launched a public education campaign to convince out-of-state boaters that Indiana is serious about collecting the tax.",

To cope with growth costs, the township imposed an impact fee on new development that led to a bitter and unresolved court challenge from home builders. Government officials also have changed a zoning code to limit the density of homes in rural areas.

    "sentence": "A real snow day. School is closed across the region opening the door for local kids to finally learn what it's like to have a snow day when there's actual snow for sledding and snowballs. It's been a while since school was cancelled due to this amount of accumulation. If you have the requisite bread and milk, feel free to turn your attention to locating a sled, some gloves and a hillside covered in snow. Sound simple? Well, it's Richmond and sledding options are a bit limited. There's a few hills, but it's hard to find a friend (or make a friend) with a decent decline in their backyard. In Henrico County, if a park is open you can use it for sled riding, just don't trespass on someone else's property, says a representative for Henrico County Police. Sledding is also permitted in Chesterfield County parks as long as park rules are followed, says Officer Morton with Chesterfield County Police. The biggest challenge may not be finding a park in Chesterfield County, but finding a hillside worthy of a sled. The winter storm has not been a long overdue play date for everyone. Travel is hazardous during a winter storm so take your time, slow down and keep plenty of distance between your vehicle and the one ahead of you. This is also a great time to practice driving without talking on the phone or sending text messages. You know who you are.",

The biggest house clocks in at 7,526 square feet at 2031 Monument Ave. with five kitchens, six living rooms, ten office spaces plus five bedrooms. Its asking price is $899,000.

She does say that house prices are down in the Richmond area and that there is more inventory on the market than in the past. “But it’s a great time to buy a house,“ Donohue says. “The rates are great.

The Belk Foundation announced Wednesday a $5,000 grant to Hope’s Wings in Richmond to help fund general operating costs for the shelter. “Hope’s Wings is a shelter committed to providing women and children who are victims of domestic abuse a safe haven,” said Katie Belk Morris, president of The Belk Foundation. “We are honored to help Hope’s Wings provide food and shelter to victims in the city of Richmond.” Hope’s Wings is committed to providing a safe environment as well as outreach services for victims of domestic violence and their children. The shelter includes around the clock staff members to monitor safety along with housing, food, clothing and basic needs. Outreach services include parenting education, support groups, counseling, legal and medical advocacy and transportation in an effort to provide support within the community. “Hope’s Wings is delighted to be the recipient of The Belk Foundation’s $5,000 New Community Initiative grant,” said Robyn Moreland, executive director of Hope’s Wings. “In tough economic times every dollar makes a difference. These funds allow us to do the work our community has such a need for.” Hope’s Wings was founded in 2006 by a group of committed community members who identified a need for domestic violence services in Madison County. The organization quickly went from a vision to a reality with the building of a 16 bed emergency shelter. The shelter opened in February 2009 and is already at 75 percent capacity. Hope’s Wings is a nonprofit organization that depends entirely on grants, donations and fundraising efforts. The mission of The Belk Foundation is to support deserving educational, religious, cultural, social, health and human services causes and organizations located in the communities where Belk associates live and work, in the states where the Belk stores are located.

    "sentence": "Army depot nominated for ‘Freedom Award’. The Blue Grass Army Depot was one of 46 Kentucky employers recently nominated to receive the 2009 Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award. Employers are nominated by their employees who serve in the Kentucky National Guard or military reserves. The nominated employers may have done a variety of things to make military life easier such as providing continued benefits while serving, differential pay and family assistance, along with other forms of support. “We are truly honored to have been nominated by our employees for this prestigious award,” said Blue Grass Army Depot Commander Col. Joseph Tirone. “While we strive to support our service members on the battlefield, we also recognize that many of our employees serve their country as Department of Army civilians at Blue Grass Army Depot and as National Guard and Reserve members. Supporting them both on and off the battlefield is key to our success,” he said. The 2009 awards will be presented at a ceremony in Washington, D. C., Thursday, Sept. 17 at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Center. More than 3,200 National Guard and Reserve members from across the country nominated their employers for their support, according to a statement released Wednesday by Lt. Col. Michelle Barrett from the Office of the Secretary of Defense. A national selection board comprised of senior defense officials and business leaders will select up to 15 recipients for this year’s award. Secretary of Defense William Perry authorized the first award in 1996 and presented it to Schneider National, McDonnell Douglas, United Parcel Service Central Florida District, Tektronix Inc. and National Life of Vermont. In the years since, more than 100 employers have received this prestigious award. The award was instituted by the National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR). ESGR is a Department of Defense agency established in 1972 whose mission is to gain and maintain employer support for guard and reserve service by recognizing outstanding support, increasing awareness of the law and resolving conflicts through mediation. The nomination process is open to all guard and reserve personnel and their families, and applications are submitted online to the ESGR.",

    "sentence": "Flood uses Lincoln portrayer to illustrate talk. When author Bracelen Flood speaks, he rarely has a Lincoln impersonator to use as a prop. However, as the author addressed a crowd of more than 220 Wednesday evening in the Grand Reading Room of Eastern Kentucky University’s library, Flood called upon living history portrayer Bob Coffey to illustrate a scene depicted in his latest book, “1864: Lincoln at the Gates of History.” When the 12,000-man force of Confederate Gen. Jubal Early threatened the capital, coming to within five miles of the White House, Lincoln visited the capital’s defenders at Fort Stevens, about five miles from the White House. Climbing upon the fort’s parapet, the 6-foot, 4-inch Lincoln, wearing his trademark stovepipe hat, presented a 7-foot silhouette at which Confederate snipers could aim. To illustrate, Flood asked Coffey to stand. The Rockcastle County resident is the same height as Lincoln and almost the same age as the president was in 1864. Wearing a stovepipe hat, Coffey appeared giant-like to the audience. In contrast, the average Union soldier’s height was only 5 feet, 6 inches. Lincoln probably is the only U.S. president to come under war-time fire while in office, Flood said. Captured Confederates later said their snipers recognized Lincoln’s unmistakable profile, but all of their bullets missed the president who would be felled by an assassin’s bullet the following year after the soldiers’ guns had fallen silent. Lincoln lived long enough, however, to stiffen the nation’s resolve in the face of military disasters, win re-election and see the Union to victory, Flood said. “How did Lincoln get his reputation for honesty?” a questioner asked after Flood’s address. Alluding to scandals of the past 35 years that have sent three Illinois governors to prison and led to another’s indictment and impeachment, “It’s not that hard for an Illinois politician to acquire a reputation for honesty,” Flood said to much laughter. An elementary school student asked Flood what he found most interesting about Lincoln. The president set aside three hours every day for citizens to meet him in his office, Flood said. “He would see about 50 people each day in the order they arrived, regardless of who they were,” the author said. Lincoln also had every letter sent to him answered, and penned a few answers himself. Those gestures allowed visitors from all over the country, even from as far as California, to see “There was a real person in the White House who care about them,” Flood said. That helped stiffened the nation’s spine when many in the North were ready to give up on the war, he said. Flood’s presentation took place in the library where he has researched four books over the past 35 years. “I am (in the Library) so much of the time that I regard the staff as my friends,” Flood wrote in the acknowledgments of the Lincoln book. The nationally acclaimed writer has worked in some of the nation’s largest and most prestigious libraries, including the Library of Congress, the Harvard University library and the New York Public Library. “What I have (at EKU) makes me competitive with people working in any university or large public library anywhere in the country,” he said Wednesday. “I’ve worked in a room at New York Public Library reserved for writers, called the Frederick Lewis Allen Writers’ Room,” the Manhattan native and Harvard graduate said. “I can tell you what I have (at EKU) works better for me than what I had at 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue (in New York City).” To express his gratitude to the library, Flood said he agreed to serve as president of the Friends of the EKU Libraries in 2006-08. “He was the leader who spearheaded the revitalization of the group,” said Carrie Cooper, dean of EKU’s libraries. “We began with a handful of supporters from years past and now have nearly 200 members of our friends group thanks to Bracelen’s leadership.” Cooper said her staff feels privileged to assist a writer of Flood’s caliber and is inspired his dedication to his work. “He is in the library many days as soon as the doors open and often doesn’t leave until late into the evening,” she said. “He eats lunch with our staff, celebrates their achievements, both personally and professionally, and has made many dear friends within our organization.” Co-sponsored by the Friends of Madison County Public Library and Friends of the EKU Libraries, Wednesday’s event also featured an exhibit of Civil War documents, including a Lincoln letter from the university’s archives, a pass the president signed for a Kentucky civilian to go through Union lines at Louisville and a parole for a Union soldier and member of the Kentucky Home Guard who was captured at the Battle of Richmond.

Author Bracelen Flood answers a question Wednesday night about his latest book, \"1864: Lincoln at the Gates of History,\" during a presentation in the Grand Reading Room of the EKU library as part of a Lincoln bicentennial celebration.",

    "sentence": "Madison Central wins state mock trial championship. The Madison Central High School mock trial team won the state championship Sunday, defeating Eastern High School of Louisville in the final round. Senior Kasey Anderson was named the tournament’s best attorney, while Junior Matt Bendure won best witness. MCHS will represent Kentucky in the national tournament to take place May 8-9 in Atlanta. Central was one of four Madison County teams in the tournament. Only Jefferson County, with seven, had more schools represented in the in the 26-team competition. Madison Southern High School and Model Laboratory School, along with Foley Middle School, took part in the tournament. Foley Middle, which earlier won its state tournament, was invited to participate and won one round before being eliminated. “All four teams represented Madison County very well,” said Madison Circuit Judge William G. Clouse Jr., who helps coach the MCHS team. “The Foley team received very complimentary remarks from the judges during of its evaluations.” Central defeated McLean County, Louisville Assumption, the Montgomery County blue team and the C.M. Gatton Academy of Math and Science before facing Eastern in the finals. Draws determined whether competitors would represent the prosecution or defense in the case of a defendant accused of selling marijuana on school property. In the finals, Central’s team successfully argued the defendant was not guilty, based on police entrapment, Clouse said. The competition, conducted in the Jefferson County Judicial Center, was judged by judges from the Kentucky Court of Appeals, circuit and district judges, attorneys and law students. “We have an exceptional group of students on our 12-member team,” Clouse said, “and they have worked extremely hard.” Clouse’s daughter, Kristin, a senior at the University of Kentucky College of Law, and Robin Lake, a senior at Chase Law School, are the attorney coaches for MCHS. Vicki Rollins is the faculty coach. The team will begin preparing today for the national competition, Judge Clouse said. “Kentucky has an outstanding reputation in the mock trial world and several schools already have sent us e-mails wanting to conduct practice scrimmages with Central after we get to Atlanta before the competition,” he said.

    "sentence": "Creating a rain garden. The Kit Carson Elementary School ecology club is putting in a flower garden. It will not be just any garden, however. “This will a rain garden, designed and constructed to decrease and filter storm water runoff,” said Tammy Ritchison, the club’s parent co-sponsor. The garden will be planted only with native plants that put down deep roots, making them drought resistant and enhancing the garden’s filtration capabilities. Rain gardens are planted in depressions, dug about 10 to 18 inches below the surrounding surface, Ritchison said. “That allows them to capture storm runoff,” she said. Water stands no more than two days in a rain garden because a mixture of organic material and/or sand is added to allow drainage. Scott Darst, Madison County extension agent for youth development, visited Kit Carson Elementary on Wednesday to help club members conduct a soil percolation test, to determine how their rain garden’s soil should be treated to ensure drainage. If properly designed and constructed, a rain garden will capture 90 percent of the precipitation dropped by a typical Kentucky rain. “Some people fear that mosquitoes will lay eggs in the water collected by a rain garden,” Ritchison said. “Mosquitoes will lay eggs in the water, but the eggs do not hatch for seven days. Because the rain garden pools drain in two days, the mosquito eggs die. That actually helps reduce the mosquito population.” The native wildflowers and grasses prescribed for a rain garden not only are beautiful, the seeds they produce attract birds that eat mosquitoes and other pests, she said. One plant native to Kentucky, the butterfly milkweed, will attract monarch butterflies to a rain garden, because the milkweed is the only plant in which the large orange and black butterfly lays its eggs. The students will plant their garden on Earth Day, April 22. The project is being funded with by a $500 grant from the Bluegrass Rain Garden Alliance. Ecology club members raised an additional $650 by selling candygrams for Valentine’s Day, Ritchison said. The school’s ecology club, which started three years ago with eight members, today includes more than 75 students from third through fifth grades. Teachers Vivian Bowles and Stacey Wills are the faculty co-sponsors. To help fulfill its grant obligations to the rain garden alliance, Kit Carson Elementary will conduct an April 18 rain garden workshop for teachers and other adults. In addition to providing instruction on rain garden design, the workshop will cover curriculum development and lesson plans, plus hands-on gardening activities.

    "sentence": "Man arrested for DUI crash into parked car. A Richmond man was charged early Sunday morning with driving under the influence and three counts of first-degree wanton endangerment after Richmond police say he struck a car stopped along Interstate 75 with a flat tire. Evan P. King, 24, of Campbell Branch Road, was weaving back and forth while driving northbound on I-75 near mile marker 89 around 2 a.m. Sunday, Richmond Police Department spokesman Sgt. Willard Reardon said in a news release. King then struck a car containing a family of three which was stopped on the side of the road with a flat tire, Reardon said. The father was attempting to change the tire while the mother and an infant in a car seat were inside the vehicle, Reardon said. The mother suffered head and leg injuries and was transported to Pattie A. Clay Regional Medical Center, Reardon said. The severity of her injuries is unknown. The infant and the father were uninjured in the crash, which slowed traffic along the interstate for 30 to 45 minutes. King was lodged in the Madison County Detention Center following the accident. He is free on a $5,000 cash bond, jail officials said Monday. City tools takenA thief stole more than $2,600 in tools from the City of Richmond’s public works department Friday. Employees at the department’s E. Walnut Street offices discovered Friday morning that someone had used an office window to break into the building and made off with a number of tools, Reardon said. Missing are three Stihl chainsaws, three bull floats, five bull float handles, a Milwaukee brand hammer drill, a power post-hole digger, an auger and a handheld Stihl concrete saw, all valued at $2,681. The thief also damaged a Pepsi vending machine while attempting to break into it, Reardon said. Other crimes Two leaf blowers were reported stolen Friday by the owner of Silver Cliff Landscaping. The backpack-style Stihl blowers were taken from a truck being used at St. Andrews Retirement Community and were valued at $1,000. More than $2,500 in electronics were reported stolen Monday morning from an apartment in the 100 block of O’Roark Avenue. The residents told police someone had cut the screen from the storm door and manipulated the lock during the early morning hours to break into the home. Missing were a Sony PlayStation 3, an XBox 360, games for both systems, 60 to 70 DVDs and two Dell Inspiron laptop computers. The items were valued at $2,550. A Louisiana man was arrested for carrying a concealed deadly weapon Sunday following a traffic stop near the Eastern Bypass. Sean Clouthier, 22, of Sulpher, La., was stopped at the intersection of Lancaster Avenue and the Eastern Bypass for a traffic stop, and a search of his vehicle uncovered a loaded 9mm pistol and a loaded .45-caliber pistol in the vehicle’s console. A wallet was reported stolen Saturday from an unlocked car parked outside the Pink Flamingo Laundromat on Big Hill Avenue. The wallet was later recovered near Advance Auto Parts, but $108 in cash had been taken. Gabriel Shearer, 34, of Richmond, was arrested Saturday for misdemeanor theft by unlawful taking after Walmart employees detained him for allegedly taking $33 in merchandise from the store. Anyone with information about these crimes is asked to call the Richmond Police Department at 623-1162 or 623-8911. Brian Smith may be reached at bsmith@richmondregister.com or at 624-6694.",

Sam Manley from the Madison County Sheriff’s Department confirmed Monday the sequence of events that sent all five people involved to the hospital with injuries. A 2005 black Ford truck being driven by Joseph Welch of Richmond was about to turn right (westbound) onto KY 52 heading toward Richmond, Manley said. A 1993 brown Cadillac driven by Larry Dunaway of Berea was traveling westbound and struck the pickup truck in the left rear, the deputy said. That then caused the truck to do a 180-degree spin, and it was left facing east in a westbound lane, Manley said. By that time, Manley said the Cadallic was facing west in the eastbound lane resulting in a head-on collision between an eastbound 1996 Chevrolet driven by David Arvin of Irvine. Arvin, Dunaway and his passenger, Barton Jones of Waco, were treated at the University of Kentucky Medical Center and were in “critical but stable” condition, according to a UK spokesperson who gave the statement Saturday afternoon. Welch and his passenger Vickie Nguyen were taken to Pattie A. Clay Medical Center where they were treated for minor injuries.",

The woman described the man who shoved her to the ground and stole her purse as a tall, large male wearing a dark or gray hooded sweatshirt, Clark said. The man fled the scene as a passenger in a green car. Clark said the woman was outside smoking behind the complex when the suspect pushed her to the ground, causing cuts to her knees and hands. “That’s why we made it a robbery first (degree), because the statute says if someone’s injured,” Clark said.

    "sentence": "Rubbish mounts as recycling plan fails. Teething problems to the council’s new waste collection services saw thousands of borough residents left with recycling piling up outside their homes. Filled recycling boxes in streets across the borough remained untouched as the council’s new recycling contractor’s SITA were nowhere to be seen last week. Since the two-week old service came into effect Hounslow Labour councillors revealed they have been repeatedly contacted by unhappy residents. Complaints have included the non-collection of recycling, non-delivery and loss of containers and emptied containers strewn across garden paths and pavements. Brentford ward councillor Ruth Cadbury said: “The numbers of complaints have rocketed and this means that people will be put off recycling. “This is terrible news for the environment, and will cost our council tax payers money as more waste goes to land-fill.” At the time the council said it believed the system, which saw new containers for paper, plastic and food waste being dropped off at homes in the borough, would make it easier for residents to recycle more of their household waste. Hounslow’s lead member for environment and planning, Councillor Barbara Reid, apologised this week for the failures of the service and said that she was taking the problem very seriously. She said: ”I want to say sorry for those residents that have been inconvenienced and give them my assurance that we are on the case. “It’s so important as recycling really is a top priority for us. There has been a huge response for from the public and that’s not a problem. That’s exactly what we want and we will respond to their enthusiasm. We are taking this very seriously.” Coun Reid said the problems had arisen after SITA had under estimated the waste and the logistics of the collection. An extra team have been commissioned to help with collections while extra staff have been brought in to respond to people’s calls. If your recycling has not been collected, contact the council’s waste management team on 020 8583 5555.",

Council staff will be driving environmentally friendly vehicles when they are out on business after a new scheme was launched this week. The cars will run on bio-fuel - recycled cooking oil - and it is hoped the move will cut costs as well as reducing carbon emissions. If the pilot scheme - believed to be a national first - is successful it will be rolled out and staff will no longer need to use their own cars for work. Councillor David Trigg, cabinet member for traffic, transport and parking, said it was part of the authority’s vision for a sustainable and integrated travel plan. \"The use of bio-fuel from used cooking oil adds extra value. The council runs its current fleet of vehicles on this fuel and this is a natural progression. “The message is clear - fundamental changes in the way we use private, shared and public transport are needed in order to fulfil the need to cut carbon emissions and tackle global warming. It's infinitely better to tackle the issues while we still have a choice. “Under the proposed scheme one pool car will provide transport for up to eight council officers, making a significant contribution to reducing carbon emissions and traffic congestion.”",

PC Doug Moore, of Hounslow safer neighbourhood team (SNT), issued the pair with a harassment warning notice to prevent them continuing their actions while he made further enquiries, and persuaded the victim to provide a statement. A month later the victim told police the pair had taken money from him and they were arrested. Lambe and Evans appeared at Feltham Magistrates’ Court on November 18, where they pleaded not guilty and elected for trial at Crown Court.

    "sentence": "Garden waste collection charge set to double. The cost of recycling green waste is set to double, affecting more than 10,000 residents. Previously residents could rent a 240 litre bin for a year from when they signed up and pay no extra for collection, or buy 110 litre green sacks for £1 each, plus postage. But from Wednesday every resident signing up to the fortnightly green waste collection scheme or renewing their agreement will have to pay the increased price. The cost of the sacks is also rising to £1.40 each. David Lawton, from the Teddington Society’s environment group, called the rise “insensitive. He said: “The council’s waste services are hardly viewed favourably across the borough. “With most residents already battling through the present financial crisis, this is a smack in the face for recycling too. “Does this administration really want us to recycle? This is the best deterrent the council could have dreamed up. “Rather than pay that extra £30, residents will resort to the car and drive to Townmead with their green waste. “Perhaps, at worst, they will stuff their black waste bags full, to add to the ever-increasing and overloaded landfill, or simply dump it as flytipping. “Is this the green Richmond we really wish to encourage?” A council spokesman said: “The £30 annual charge, set in 2005, falls far short of covering running costs. “To avoid having to subsidise the service we have elected instead to increase the charge, so it is only those who use the service who pay for it. “We have made extra effort to contact residents whose hire contracts were due for renewal during February and March, so they could update their contracts before the new charges come into effect on April 1. “Residents are encouraged to consider using home composting, which is the cheapest and most sustainable way to recycle green waste. “The free garden waste service at Townmead Road Recycling Centre in Kew continues to be available.”",

Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: “Despite its leafy image, Richmond faces the same challenges in terms of congestion and air pollution as other parts of London. “This scheme will help make the borough an even greener, healthier place for people to live and work. “I can imagine nothing better than cycling through parts of Richmond, but this will mean that people across the borough will find it much easier to take to two wheels.” The money will be used to create 450 new cycle parking spaces - 200 were installed before the official launch - two new cycle routes, new cycling facilities and car club bays, cycle training sessions and improve signage and mapping for pedestrians in Richmond and Twickenham town centres. There will also be the introduction of ‘Walk on Wednesday’ to all primary schools in the borough and the development of travel plans, and the provision of more information on sustainable transport to residents, schools and businesses. TfL’s director for transport policy, Kulveer Ranger, added: “Underlying all of that, is TfL working with the borough to see how we can reduce our carbon footprint. “Eighty eight per cent of people who live in Richmond feel there is a problem with traffic, we know we cannot keep buying and using more and more cars.” “This is a major initiative to ask people - residents, businesses and schools - to use sustainable transport which is smarter, better for the environment.”",

Bosses are pledging to wage war on the unsightly scrawls - and are calling on residents to help them wipe it out by reporting graffiti whenever they spot it. According to Government indicators, up to 17 per cent of streets in Hounslow are affected by graffiti. Council cleaning squads will aim to remove the equivalent of 13 football pitches worth of graffiti in the next year alone. As he prepares to take to the streets to help a council cleaning crew on Tuesday, council leader, Peter Thompson, said: “We’ve invested an extra £280,000 to help us wipe out graffiti across the borough, but we can’t do it by ourselves. We need people to let us know when it appears so we can remove it quickly. “People feel less safe in streets which are blighted by problems like graffiti. There is a clear link between antisocial behaviour like graffiti and fear of more serious crime. So, tackling this problem will really make Hounslow a better place to live. \"We want people to be proud of where they live, and not just accept graffiti as something they have to put up with. “Everyone has the power to improve their area. If you’re sick of graffiti then please pick up the phone and let us know. If you report it, we’ll remove it.” In 2006 there was just one council graffiti squad operating in the borough. From next month, this will increase to four. This latest crackdown comes as part of the council’s campaign to “build pride borough wide”. A recent report by Keep Britain Tidy highlighted the importance of the council’s campaign to wipe out graffiti. The report found people feel unsafe in areas which suffer from graffiti. The study also highlighted a possible “climate of resignation” where residents were less likely to report problems like graffiti because they had come to accept them as the norm. Anyone who wants to report graffiti can contact the council’s call centre on 020 8583 5555.",

    "sentence": "Firearms expert to testify at Dziekanski inquiry. A Delta police officer has been called to testify at the public inquiry into the death of Polish immigrant Robert Dziekanski following a 2007 confrontation with RCMP officers at Vancouver International Airport. Dziekanski died after he was shocked several times by a Taser wielded by RCMP Const. Kwesi Millington, one of four airport police who said Dziekanski was hit with the high-voltage electrical stun gun because he was acting in a threatening manner. Following the incident, the RCMP asked the Delta Police Department’s firearms expert Const. Craig Baltzer to examine the Taser that was fired at Dziekanski by Millington. Baltzer downloaded information from a computer chip that is included with each Taser designed to record every discharge of the device. The constable will give evidence about his findings when the public inquiry chaired by Thomas Braidwood resumes on March 23. The Delta officer is expected to take the stand some time after RCMP Cpl. Benjamin Robinson, one of the four airport officers and the supervisor on duty at the time Dziekanski died. Before the inquiry took a two-week break, it heard the RCMP officer who fired the Taser admit that he’d made erroneous statements in his report about the deadly encounter. Millington originally stated that Dziekanski had to be repeatedly shocked because he didn’t immediately fall to the ground. But a video taken by a witness shows that Dziekanski did fall to the ground when stunned. Millington also denied the officers had met to discuss the incident, even though one of his colleagues said they had. And he told the inquiry he never overheard his fellow officers discuss the incident. Millington was the only officer armed with a Taser, and had only recently been trained in its use. He also said he didn’t issue a warning to Dziekanski that he was going to use the Taser because he felt he didn’t have time and that Dziekanski, who was holding a stapler, was posing a threat to himself and the other officers. Dziekanski died in the international arrivals area of Vancouver International Airport after spending more than 10 hours waiting for his mother Zofia Cisowski.",

Too many people toss old medications in the trash or flush them down the drain instead of using an existing return program, according to Metro Vancouver. An estimated 21 per cent of area residents are aware pharmacies take back unused medicine, non-prescription drugs, as well as vitamins, minerals and herbal supplements. That's too low, say Metro Vancouver officials, who are aiming to boost participation in the free Medications Return Program. Pharmaceuticals that end up in landfills or in the sewer system can make their way into the environment. There it's feared they can poison or disrupt hormone levels and normal reproductive cycles in aquatic life, and potentially contribute to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Metro Vancouver already banned the disposal of pharmaceuticals from landfill disposal last year. Eliminating expired or unwanted drugs from medicine cabinets also ensures they aren't someday consumed by accident. About 40 tonnes of prescription and over-the-counter drugs are safely returned to pharmacies for safe disposal each year.",

    "sentence": "Cold winters may be new trend. After enduring the coldest winter in 16 years and now persistent below-normal temperatures that are chilling what should be spring, Richmondites can be excused for asking what gives. Meteorologists suspect coastal B.C. is now being nipped by a trend of colder than normal winter temperatures that could last a decade. Or two. Or three. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation is a phenomenon of alternating phases in which offshore ocean temperatures tend to run warmer and then colder—for 20 to 30 years at a stretch. “There’s some debate as to whether we’ve slipped into a cold phase or not,” said Environment Canada meteorologist Gabor Fricska. “It may be too early to say definitively.” A warm Pacific Decadal Oscillation phase was measured from 1920-1945 followed by a cold phase that lasted until 1975, bringing the Lower Mainland many severe winters. Since then it’s been a mixed bag: three cold years until 2002, then four more warmer years. But Fricska says some meteorologists think the recent spate of cold weather may be the onset of a new cold phase. “It is cold right now,” he said. “The sea surface temperatures immediately off of our coast are one to two degrees below normal.” Three out of the last four seasons (except last fall) have been colder than seasonal, he added. When a cold Pacific Decadal Oscillation phase is prevalent, winter low pressure systems in the Gulf of Alaska are often weaker than usual, allowing more cold air to come down to the coast from northern B.C. For anyone wanting proof of the hardship endured in the winter of 2008-09, Fricska offers these Metro Vancouver stats for December-January-February, from the airport weather station: It was the coldest winter since 1992-93 and the 10th coldest since record keeping began in 1937. Mean temperatures for the three months averaged 2.4 C, down from a normal of 3.6 degrees. Snowfall was more than two and a half times normal—109 cms versus 42.5—while rainfall was 35 per cent below normal. “People aren’t imagining things if they think it’s colder,” Fricska said. How could this be happening in an era of global warming? Fricska said Pacific Decadal Oscillations and shorter duration weather variations like El Nino are regional shifts that don’t reflect what’s happening at the planetary level. He noted B.C. experienced many of its coldest winters in recent memory during the cold oscillation cycle from 1945 to 1975—even though global air temperatures climbed steadily during that period. Yet more snow fell this week at some higher elevations around the Lower Mainland. “Our seasonal forecast for the spring is for continuing below normal temperatures on the coast,” Fricska said.",

    "sentence": "Council of Europe Doesn’t Envisage Use of Sanctions. MOSCOW — Russia’s membership in the Council of Europe is not threatened by sanctions, despite Moscow’s continued refusal to ratify two key human rights protocols, two of the council’s top politicians said Wednesday. Luc van den Brande and Theodoros Pangalos, who monitor Russia’s compliance with its commitments to the council, said talk of sanctions against Moscow was groundless and that they hoped that the State Duma would soon ratify the outstanding protocols. “I do not like sanctions. It is important that Russia is not marginalized,” van den Brande told reporters after two days of talks with government officials and Duma deputies. Russia has irked many in the 47-member council by being the only country that has not ratified two amendments to the European Convention on Human Rights. Protocol 6 requires signatories to restrict the use of the death penalty to times of war. Protocol 14 stipulates reforms for the European Court of Human Rights. Pangalos, a former Greek foreign minister and Socialist member of parliament, complained that Russia’s obstinacy was hampering the development of the whole council. He questioned arguments by Russian officials that public opinion was not ready for a formal abolition of capital punishment by pointing out that it was no longer carried out. “Why do you not apply it and at the same time say it is approved by the population?” he asked. Russia has maintained a moratorium on the death penalty since 1996, when it joined the Council of Europe. Pangalos said the nonratification of the protocol for reforming the European Court of Human Rights was even stranger given that officials in the Justice Ministry told him that they were in favor of ratification. “The ball is in the field of the Duma,” he said. The proposed reforms seek to improve the court’s efficiency by filtering out cases that have less chance of succeeding. Konstantin Kosachyov, chairman of the Duma’s International Relations Committee, criticized the protocol as ineffective. “It has many shortcomings and won’t lead to real reform,” he said late Tuesday, Interfax reported.",

    "sentence": "Russian artists in America. Generations of Russian artists who emigrated to the U.S. are on display at the Russian Museum. David Burliuk’s ‘Portrait of Professor Nicholas K. Roerich’ (1929) is one of the items displayed. In David Burliuk’s “Hudson,” a view of the New York City skyline seems to fly apart into ribbons of image and memory like a fleeting dream. But for Burliuk and the other Russian emigre artists featured in a new exhibition at the Russian Museum, America was a tangible reality that strongly influenced the development of their art, as demonstrated by Burliuk’s departure from his earlier work in “Hudson.” The traveling exhibition, titled “American Artists from the Russian Empire,” includes 45 artists who left Russia or the Soviet Union for America in the first half of the 20th century, and is the first time such a cast of artists has been assembled. “Some go together, some don’t,” said Yevgenia Petrova, deputy director of the State Russian Museum and the project’s main creative force. “It’s a cross-section of what went on in Russian-American art up to the middle of the 20th century.” This schizophrenic amalgam of paintings and sculptures runs the gamut from Neo-classicism to Abstract art and includes several generations of artists, from Cubo-futurist Max Weber to Alexander Liberman. The idea came from a 2003 exhibition of Russians who emigrated to France. The American-based Foundation for International Arts and Education organized the exhibition, drawing from museums, galleries and private collections in the U.S. The show made its debut at the Fred Jones Jr. Museum at the University of Oklahoma this spring, and will return to San Diego after a two-month run at Moscow’s Tretyakov Gallery this summer. Its appearance in St. Petersburg marks the first time these works have been shown in Russia. “For the American public, the goal is to remind viewers that these artists had Russian roots, to point out what they brought from Russia to American art, and what from American art influenced them,” Petrova said. In Russia, the exhibition aims to familiarize viewers with new art. “For [these artists], showing in Russia was impossible because of the Iron Curtain; it wasn’t patriotic to show such work,” Petrova said. American visitors will likely know artists like Mark Rothko, whose distinctive abstract style featuring solid blocks of color has become an icon of American art. Russian art-lovers, on the other hand, may know Boris Grigoryev, whose striking, slightly off-kilter portraits and depictions of peasant life have been extensively exhibited in Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union. The first wave of Russian artists to move to America was mainly made up of Jews who left before the Bolshevik Revolution, seeking chances to exhibit and study art after suffering anti-Semitism in Russia. “They left to obtain an education and gain freedom,” Petrova said. Life in the Jewish Pale denied these artists a chance to show their work or communicate with kindred spirits on the international art scene, she explained. After the revolution, many more artists fled in the face of violence, starvation and political persecution during the Civil War and under the Soviet regime. “They left … to avoid prison and stay alive, but also to keep working; they didn’t want to take part in Socialist realism,” Petrova said. Once in the United States, Russian artists were exposed to fluid, “contagious” new influences that profoundly affected their work, Petrova said. “The Burliuk painting of New York is so unexpected for Burliuk, it shows how strongly American art influenced these artists,” she said. At the same time, the Russian artists influenced their American counterparts and retained something distinctly Russian in their work. Petrova pointed to surrealist painter Pavel Tchelitchew, who is included in the exhibition, and how his overarching aesthetic resembled that of Pavel Filonov, who remained in Russia. Although the two men most likely didn’t know each other’s work, they arrived at similar ideas on “what’s close to man in nature” thanks to a shared background in Russian natural philosophy, she said. Shannon and Julie Ward, visiting from Los Angeles, said the exhibition showcased the ties between Russian and American art. “There’s really a lot of crossover; American artists looked like Russians and vice versa,” Julie said. “American Artists from the Russian Empire” runs through June at the State Russian Museum, 4 Inzhenernaya Ulitsa, M: Gostiny Dvor.

    "sentence": "Iraqi Officials: Car Bomb Kills 20 in Baghdad. BAGHDAD — A car bomb exploded near a crowded market in a mainly Shiite area in Baghdad on Thursday, killing as many as 20 people, Iraqi officials said, in the fifth major attack in Iraq this month. The blast came a day after the U.S. military said overall attacks nationwide have fallen to levels of the early months of the war, which began with the U.S.-led invasion in March 2003. The car was parked near a bus terminal surrounded by shops in the eastern Shaab district when it blew up shortly after noon on Thursday, the officials said. Iraqi police and hospital officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to release the information, said the 20 killed included four children and four women. The officials said 35 people also were wounded. The U.S. military confirmed the attack but said preliminary reports indicated eight people were killed and 14 were wounded. Conflicting casualty tolls are common in the aftermath of bombings. Shaab is a former Shiite militia stronghold that has seen a drop in violence since cleric Muqtada al-Sadr declared a cease-fire amid a crackdown by the U.S. and Iraqi militaries.",

    "sentence": "Eight Alleged Plotters Detained in Georgia. TBILISI, Georgia — A Georgian court ruled Wednesday that eight opposition supporters accused of plotting a coup and terrorist acts should remain in custody for two months as they await trial. Police released video recordings this week allegedly showing the men trying to buy weapons with the intent of causing violence during opposition protests next month. Most of those sent to detention are supporters of the party of Nino Burdzhanadze, a former parliamentary speaker who once was one of President Mikheil Saakashvili’s closest allies. Burdzhanadze broke with Saakashvili last year and now is one of the key figures in the call for big rallies on April 9 that will demand that Saakashvili step down. The saga has echoes of 2007, when the government accused opposition figures, based partly on video evidence, of trying to stage a coup during opposition protests that were smashed by police. On Wednesday, officials released more recordings of alleged coup plans by opposition members. One recording purportedly shows a member of Burdzhanadze’s party, Roina Bukhrashvili, as saying that a civil war would be in the party’s interests. Dissatisfaction with Saakashvili has grown since a brief but devastating war with Russia last August.",

    "sentence": "Debates Reflect Anti-Gay Feeling. As the Week Against Homophobia gets underway in St. Petersburg and several other Russian cities, Wednesday’s debates at Sochi music bar showed that gay rights activists have a long way to go to overcome the superstitions. One of the two participants, Mikhail Potepkin of the Kremlin-backed youth movement Nashi, who described himself as “homonegativist,” compared homosexuality to necrophilia and bestiality and said that as a member of a sexual majority, he has the right not to see gay people on Nevsky Prospekt, St. Petersburg’s main street. Potepkin’s supporters reacted by giggling and applauding his jokes, and in subsequent discussions in the blogosphere, his views were largely considered to be “moderate.” But Valery Sozayev, chairman of the board of Vykhod (Coming Out), St. Petersburg’s gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights organization that was founded last year, believes the discussion was useful. “Unfortunately — or fortunately, we saw the true colors of the contemporary political scene as it is,” Sozayev said by phone on Thursday. “Our politicians cannot speak normally about violations of the rights of the LGBT community. For them, it is all either very funny or very scabrous, and we saw more evidence of this yesterday. But the fact that it was articulated, that it entered the public space, the space of public youth politics is already an achievement, because it would not have been possible even 12 months ago. “We are starting to come out, so the reaction will naturally be negative and tough on the part of homophobes, but we should be prepared for that. We merely see confirmation of the necessity of our work. The Week Against Homophobia is dedicated to the memory of victims of political repression. “The year of 2009 has been declared a year for remembering gays and lesbians who were the victims of political repression, because this year it will be 75 years since consensual same-sex relations between men became criminally punishable under the Soviet Criminal Code,” Sozayev said. Similar events have been held in the city in the past, but this year, importantly, it is part of Xenophobii.NET, or the No to Xenophobia campaign, which was launched on March 15 and continues through Sunday. “It’s interesting and positive that in St. Petersburg it has become part of the coalition and is held with the support of other public organizations, and this is for the first time,” Sozayev said. “Many public organizations, both human rights and political, have supported this event.” Although Vykhod takes part in demonstrations such as last year’s anti-Nazi March Against Hatred, Sozayev described his organization as “non-political.” “The March Against Hatred is not a political march, it’s a citizens’ march, [but] we don’t take part in and are not planning to take part in political events, because people who belong to the LGBT community have diverse political views, so we cannot maintain a specific political view. “Our task is not to confront the authorities, but to help them to fulfill the obligations they took on for themselves.” Last year, however, the gay community saw a clampdown by the St. Petersburg authorities. In October, Side by Side, St. Petersburg’s first lesbian and gay film festival, had to take place in private after fire inspectors suddenly shut down the two venues due to host the event. Those venues had in turn been hurriedly booked after Pik Cinema mysteriously withdrew its support for the festival. Earlier in the year, gay clubs Central Station and Bunker were subject to police raids. “I think that despite everything, we can cooperate with the authorities,” Sozayev said. “The fact that some events are being held now and that the authorities are not putting any pressure on these events is also indicative of that, as well as the fact that our organization was officially registered with no problems [in January]. “We can’t see what is on the authorities’ mind, but some process is underway.”",

    "sentence": "Freemason Bogdanov Joins Sochi Mayor Race. Former presidential candidate Andrei Bogdanov on Wednesday became the latest entry into the crowded Sochi mayoral election, saying the Black Sea resort could become “the Nice of Russia.” Bogdanov, 39, is the former head of the now-defunct Democratic Party of Russia, which was widely seen as a Kremlin-controlled project to draw votes away from actual opposition candidates and give voters a tame liberal option. “Sochi should become the Nice of Russia, where the majority can earn a living through small businesses,” Bogdanov told The Moscow Times on Wednesday after submitting his registration papers to the Sochi elections commission. The mayoral election in Sochi, which is slated to host the 2014 Winter Olympics, has become one of the year’s most intriguing political events. Several high-profile candidates, including opposition politician Boris Nemtsov and businessman Alexander Lebedev, have already announced that they would run for the post. Bogdanov’s bid brings to the election one of the country’s most curious political actors. Though virtually unknown nationally, Bogdanov was the only independent candidate who managed to get on the ballot of the 2008 presidential election by collecting 2 million signatures to support his campaign. Critics call Bogdanov a Kremlin stooge and say his inclusion on the presidential ballot was merely a Kremlin move to have a token liberal in the election, which Dmitry Medvedev won by a landslide. Promising to make Russia an EU member, Bogdanov captured a measly 1.3 percent of the vote. Bogdanov, who also who heads up the country’s largest Masonic lodge, told The Moscow Times by telephone Wednesday that he would again run as an independent in the Sochi election. Twenty-two candidates had applied to get on the ballot as of Wednesday, Interfax reported. The deadline to register for the April 26 election is Thursday. State Duma Deputy Andrei Lugovoi, who faces murder charges in Britain in connection with the 2006 poisoning death of Alexander Litvinenko in London, had expressed interest in running but announced this week that he would not enter the race. The United Russia candidate, acting Sochi Mayor Anatoly Pakhomov, is seen as a favorite in the election.",

    "sentence": "Russian-American Crew Blasts Off to Space Station. BAIKONUR, Kazakhstan — A Soyuz capsule carrying a Russian-American crew and U.S billionaire space tourist Charles Simonyi blasted off for the international space station Thursday. The Russian rocket lifted off on schedule from the Baikonur cosmodrome facility in a roar of fire and soared into the cold, overcast skies over northern Kazakhstan’s barren steppes. Simonyi, a software designer paying $35 million for his second trip on the Soyuz, joined Russian cosmonaut Gennady Padalka and American astronaut Michael Barratt in the cramped capsule, where they will sit for nearly two days before hooking up with the station, orbiting some 350 kilometers above the Earth. Minutes after blast-off, TV cameras from inside the Soyuz showed Padalka and Barratt waving for the camera and giving the thumbs-up OK sign. At viewing stands a few hundred meters away, scores of officials, reporters and relatives watched the launch, including Simonyi’s 28-year-old Swedish socialite wife Lisa Persdotter, who wept and clutched at the coat of a relative. “I’m very, very happy. It was very, very smooth,” she said afterward. Also watching was Paul Allen, a co-founder of software giant Microsoft Corp., where Simonyi worked for many years. “It’s fantastic to see a launch, but when it’s one of your friends, it’s just something so special,” he said. Asked if he would be interested in going to space sometime, Allen said he would consider it; not on the Russian capsules or U.S. shuttles, but on one of his own crafts. In 2004, Allen used his Microsoft fortunes to bankroll SpaceShipOne, which in 2004 became the first private, manned craft to reach space. While Barratt and Padalka will join the current station’s permanent crew, Simonyi will return to Earth 13 days later — a trip that will make him the first two-time space tourist and, for the foreseeable future, the last.",

    "sentence": "Santa Clara murder still haunts family 15 years later. At first, the Christmas cards from their son's old boss arrived year after year at the Mauro home, always remembering the promising young engineer, gunned down in broad daylight at Applied Materials. Then, eventually, the cards stopped. So, too, did the calls from police. What hasn't stopped are the restless nights, lying awake, tormented with the same piercing questions about a murder that happened 15 years ago today. Who would have wanted Matthew D. Flores dead? Why would anyone want to kill the handsome, charismatic husband and father — a decorated Army veteran who led a seemingly ordinary life? \"It's been 15 years, it is still an unsolved homicide and nothing has ever come about,\" said Mike Mauro, Flores' stepfather. \"We're still hoping someday, someone will call us and say, 'Here's what happened and here's the reason.' \" But the mystery surrounding the case still haunts them as they wait in frustration for Santa Clara police to find their son's shooter, a phantom-like killer who slipped away without a trace from the parking lot of Building 12 on March 24, 1994. But there was one potentially explosive piece of evidence caught on a grainy security videotape — a black and white Ford Explorer, seen circling the parking lot before the shooting, then leaving only seconds after Flores was shot. The driver has never been found. \"The most puzzling thing about this case is that it was so busy that morning, yet we didn't have as many witnesses as you would think there would be,'' said Capt. Stewart Cusimano, who's been at the department for 29 years. \"That's what was really lacking here.\" Flores, 26, had just left the Army where he had served as a lieutenant during Operation Desert Storm. He had moved his wife and 8-month-old daughter, Danielle, to Santa Clara for a job at Applied Materials where he was to train for a few months before transferring to the company's Dallas office. \"He had paid his dues and put himself through college,'' said his mother, Ellen Mauro, from her home in Rhode Island, where Flores grew up. \"This was his big chance and he never got to enjoy it.\" In the 15 years since Flores' death, Mauro hounded the FBI, congressional leaders and former U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno for help in her son's case. She even sought out psychics. Nothing panned out. \"I spent more than five years going everywhere and anywhere to anyone who I thought could help,'' she said, \"and all I would get were doors slammed in my face or letters saying, 'We can't help you.' '' His widow, Denise, a nurse who lives in Massachusetts, never remarried and both she and Danielle always wonder why Flores' life was taken so brutally. \"We lived very ordinary lives,'' she said. \"There have been so many days and nights when I've thought of every possible scenario and nothing makes sense.\" Danielle knows her father only through videos and photographs, including one near the Golden Gate Bridge taken days before his death, where's he's holding her in his arms. Flores' case has appeared on \"Unsolved Mysteries,\" airing periodically over the years and occasionally generating new leads. \"We've probably spent more time on this case than any other case that I can recall,\" Cusimano said. More recently, Santa Clara police had consultants look at the case, submitted new evidence to the lab and reviewed the surveillance tape. Detectives also took a new look at his military connections, exploring his relationships and assignments. Flores had no known enemies, so there's a question whether it could have been a case of mistaken identity. \"There are no facts that can substantiate a theory,\" Cusimano said. The family, however, remains frustrated with police. Cusimano said he understands. \"I don't blame them. I'm frustrated. This is one of those cases that I have always taken a personal interest in.\" At Applied Materials, the executives who knew Flores are gone. His old boss, Gary Robertson, who found him in the parking lot that day, no longer wants to talk about the case. And, since Flores had been at the tech company just days, not many knew him. Still, a reminder of him lingers at the company's sprawling campus. There, near the dull forbidding concrete Building 12 on Oakmead Village Drive, is a scarcely noticeable barren tree planted in Flores' honor. Next to it lies a tombstone-like granite monument ensconced in a cluster of rocks with a plaque. It says simply: Matthew D. Flores, 1967-1994. Murder victim Matthew Flores was killed in 1994 in the Applied Materials parking lot. The case is still unsolved. This is Flores' ID badge for Applied Materials.

Not the woman who heard the shot and turned to see his kneeling body, slumped next to the driver's door of his sedan. Nor the other drivers who entered the parking lot just before he was shot once in the back of the head at point-blank range. None of the security cameras captured the shooting, and there was no shell casing from a weapon or sign of a struggle. None of his belongings were taken.",

    "sentence": "Oakland officer shot by parolee is taken off life support. SAN FRANCISCO — A fourth Oakland police officer who was shot by a 26-year-old man wanted on a parole violation has been taken off of life support, a hospital spokeswoman said Tuesday. Officer John Hege was taken off life support Monday night, said Andrea Breaux of Alameda County Medical Center. The 41-year-old Concord resident's family had kept him alive so his organs could be donated, in keeping with his wishes. Breaux said the process of harvesting Hege's organs started just after 8 p.m. Monday and was completed by 2 a.m. today. According to police, Hege and a partner, Sgt. Mark Dunakin, were gunned down when they pulled over the parolee on Saturday. A massive manhunt ensued and two more officers died when the city's SWAT team stormed an apartment where the suspected gunman, Lovelle Mixon, was hiding. Mixon was fatally shot. The two officers who were killed at the apartment were Sgt. Ervin Romans, 43, and Sgt. Daniel Sakai, 35. \"This is the biggest tragedy ever to hit our department,\" Oakland police Sgt. Mark Schmid said Monday. \"We're just numb and walking around like zombies. We feel each other's pain but we don't know how to explain it.\" Flowers piled up outside Oakland police headquarters and books brimmed with condolences. A vigil was planned for Tuesday evening at the corner near where the two motorcycle officers pulled over Mixon. DNA found at the scene of the rape was a probable match to Lovelle Mixon, Oakland police spokesman Jeff Thomason said Monday night. Investigators got that information Friday, the day before the routine traffic stop ended in gunfire. California prison records show that authorities had issued a warrant for Mixon's arrest after he failed to make a mandatory meeting with his parole officer on Feb. 19. The family said he had previously served six years in state prison for assault with a firearm during an armed robbery in San Francisco. More recently, he had served several months in prison last year. State Attorney General Jerry Brown said he will examine how Mixon, 26, was monitored following his release from prison in November. Mixon also was a suspect in a murder but was never charged, according to state prison officials. \"Mixon was certainly a character that needed more supervision,\" said Brown, the former mayor of Oakland. \"In Oakland, the highway patrol has an office there, sheriff and police. And all those agencies should have a list of the more dangerous, threatening parolees so they can keep a watch on them.\" Problems involving parolees from California's overcrowded prison system have long beset state officials who must monitor them, local officials who try to keep streets safe and federal authorities who enforce firearms and other laws. Mixon was one of 164 Oakland parolees in mid-March who had outstanding arrest warrants for parole violations, state prison records show. The city of 400,000 had more than 1,900 total parolees at the time, including nearly 300 who had been returned to custody or whose parole was about to be revoked. During traffic stops, police often check vehicle records to find whether the driver has outstanding warrants. But police have not disclosed how Saturday's shooting unfolded. Mixon's family members said he was upset that he was unable to find work, felt his parole officer was not helping him and feared he would be arrested for a parole violation. State prison officials said Mixon's parole officer was responsible for 70 parolees. A caseload of that size is nearly unmanageable, and also not unusual, said Lance Corcoran, spokesman for California's prison guard union, which includes parole officers. \"There is no control,\" Corcoran said. \"It's simply supervision, and supervision at distance.\" Associated Press writers Josh Dubow, Lisa Leff and Juliana Barbassa in San Francisco and Terry Collins in Oakland contributed to this report. This is an undated photo released by the Oakland Police Department of Oakland Police officer John Hege. A man wanted for violating his parole killed three police officers and gravely wounded Hege in two shootings Saturday, March 21, 2009. Hege was taken off life support Tuesday.

    "sentence": "Santa Clara Valley Water District calls for mandatory rationing. Silicon Valley's largest water supplier voted unanimously today to call for mandatory rationing, asking residents and businesses to cut back 15 percent this summer. Santa Clara Valley Water District directors voted 7-0 for the rationing measure after more than two hours of discussion. The move comes after three consecutive dry years. Directors indicated they will spend $2 million on an outreach campaign encouraging people to conserve. The district — which provides drinking water for 1.8 million people in Santa Clara County from Los Altos to Gilroy — has no enforcement powers because it is a wholesale provider of water. But the board can ask the district's 13 retail suppliers, such as the San Jose Water Company and the cities of Sunnyvale and Morgan Hill, to set up new pricing rules that charge customers a premium if they use more than a set amount of water. The district will also ask every city in Santa Clara County to approve an ordinance that would ban lawn watering during daytime hours, require nozzles on garden hoses and limit watering to odd-even days, with fines for violators. In late May, the city of San Jose will vote on its ordinance, which would take effect in June. City officials said today they were unsure if that would include fines. reduced pumping for the portion of the delta it controls to 20 percent of contracted amounts, and federal officials, who control another portion, have reduced it to 50 percent. Despite February rains, large reservoirs that feed the delta are only half full from two dry years.",

    "sentence": "Santa Clara County sex assault conviction overturned. A state appeals court has reversed a Santa Clara County sexual assault conviction, finding the defendant received a \"grossly unfair trial'' because a trial judge allowed the prosecutor to improperly rely on a separate indecent exposure allegation to persuade the jury to return a guilty verdict. In a ruling last week, a divided panel of the San Jose-based 6th District Court of Appeal overturned Cameron Lee Earle's conviction for assaulting a woman in a local parking lot in December 2004. The appeals court concluded that Earle's trial was tainted because Superior Court Judge Rene Navarro allowed the jury to consider a separate, unrelated misdemeanor indecent exposure charge, which was emphasized heavily by the prosecutor. The 6th District found that the evidence against Earle was weak and circumstantial in the more serious sexual assault case, and that trying the two allegations at the same time allowed prosecutors to exploit the indecent exposure evidence \"through spurious legal theories'' to convict Earle. The appellate panel ruled that Earle was entitled to separate trials on the two distinct charges. Justice Nathan Mihara dissented, saying trying the two charges together did not deprive Earle of a fair trial and did not prejudice the outcome. Earle is currently serving his sentence of five years and eight months in prison for his convictions.",

    "sentence": "Risks pay off for Saratoga native who's film 'Haunting in Connecticut' is about to be released. Andrew Trapani is a gambling man. Rising from a West Valley College student to video game tester to Hollywood producer is a testament to Trapani's willingness to work hard and take risks. Those risks have paid off as Trapani's first major-release feature film, \"The Haunting in Connecticut,\" will open in theaters on March 27. But Trapani's story really begins about 20 years ago. Trapani rose quickly through the ranks in his five years with the company, going from game tester to designer and then ultimately to producer. The Saratoga native oversaw the development of some of the first Sony Playstation games, which was a transitioning period for video game developers as games went from cartridges to a CD format, which gave video games richer and more robust play, Trapani said. But one of the moments that steered the course of his career came in the late 1990s, when he produced a 30-minute movie-esque narrative for the video game, Solar Eclipse. Trapani and his crew spent three days shooting footage in Los Angeles. One day he and a peer were discussing what they would do if they won the lottery. Trapani said he would produce movies. After some thought, Trapani said he realized that he didn't have to win the lottery. So in March 1998 he resigned from his position and decided not long after to move to Los Angeles. \"I didn't have it all figured out, but I knew I wanted to do movies,\" he said. \"I always knew I wanted to do something that didn't require that I wear a suit every day.\" Within his first year in Los Angeles Trapani produced the independent film, \"True Rights,\" about a camera crew that chases down news events in hopes of locking up a movie deal. The movie was shot in 18 days on 35-millimeter film in what Trapani calls a \"run and gun, guerilla-style\" format. While in post-production on \"True Rights,\" Trapani received a call from someone he had worked with on the film, asking if he would be interested in producing commercials. Trapani said yes and spent a few months on commercial production. In 2000 Trapani founded Integrated Films, a production and management company, which has produced the movies Borderland, Tamara and the remake of Amityville Horror. But in a few days Trapani's latest film, \"The Haunting in Connecticut,\" will hit theaters across the nation, which will undoubtedly have much more exposure to a wider audience than any of his previous films. \"I'm really proud of it. I'm proud of everyone who contributed to it,\" he said. \"The Haunting\" is based on the true story of the Snedeker family, who moved into a Connecticut home back in the 1980s that had once been a mortuary. The story goes that the family was looking for an affordable place to live where their son, who was undergoing cancer treatment, could be closer to the hospital where he was receiving treatment. The family, not knowing the dark history of the home, began having unexplained things happen in their house. The movie stars Academy Award-nominated actress Virginia Madsen (\"Sideways\"). The idea to do this movie came to Trapani after he watched a 2003 documentary on the family on the Discovery Channel. He thought the story would make a great movie and contacted the family, eventually receiving the rights to make a feature film. Two years later Trapani was able to sell the movie to Gold Circle Films, an independent film production company, and the writers were able to begin putting together the script. \"At that point we were finally on our way to getting the movie made,\" Trapani said. The producer said that he knows that no matter how well this movie does, the mass audience will most likely never know who he is. And he says he is just fine with that. \"I didn't come to Los Angeles to be an actor,\" he said. \"Fame is not of interest to me.\" Instead, Trapani said he's much more interested in putting out quality films and having the respect of his peers. That's much more valuable to him, he says, and more in line with what he cares about. \"At the end of the day it's up to the producer to protect the integrity of the movie,\" he said. \"I just love movies. I understand them in a way that is a byproduct of what I was predisposed to do.\" Just as he's done with his career, Trapani said he follows his gut when it comes to making a movie. If it feels right, go for it; if not, something needs to change. He'll need his instincts to help him as he and his business partner, Brian Gilbert, move forward with other projects in their new production and management venture. Gilbert is the former production president of Stan Winston Studio, which was involved in such films as Jurassic Park, Alien and Iron Man, Trapani said. Trapani and Gilbert have already signed on for two Scooby Doo film sequels and a movie starring Nicholas Cage that will start filming early next year. The two are also involved in representing screenwriters and directors and helping them focus on their long-term career goals. Trapani admits that life can be a little overwhelming at times, especially since he can be working on 60 different projects at various stages of development. But he said he feeds off of it and is enthralled with film production. When things do get a little crazy on set, Trapani says that he thinks about Geoffrey Rush's character from \"Shakespeare in Love.\" Rush's character, Philip Henslowe, is asked how the play will be ready with so much madness going on around them. Rush replies, \"It's a mystery.\" He grew up in Saratoga, but it's Hollywood that Andy Trapani now calls home. Trapani is a movie producer, and his first major feature film,`The Haunting in Connecticut,' will hit the theaters on March 27.",

    "sentence": "Investors flock to buy California bonds. SACRAMENTO — Investors this week flocked to California's first major bond sale in nine months, a development that will soon free up billions of dollars for public works projects put on hold because of the state's budget mess. State Treasurer Bill Lockyer announced that the state sold $6.54 billion in general obligation bonds on Monday and Tuesday, easily surpassing a $4 billion target he had set going into the sale. His office said late Tuesday it was the largest long-term general obligation bond sale \"ever in the country.\" The tax-exempt bonds carry yields ranging from 3.2 to 6.1 percent, depending on when they mature (from 2013 to 2038). \"This is a great result for California's workers, businesses and economy,\" Lockyer said in a statement. California has been shut out of the debt market because of its budget mess and the tight national credit market. And without the ability to sell bonds, the state was forced to freeze about $2.6 billion in financing since December for more than 5,000 infrastructure projects. With the deficit addressed for the time being with the plan signed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger last month, officials said recently that they expect soon to unfreeze $500 million in infrastructure funds that had been put on hold. But after this week's sale, they are expected to unlock an additional $2.6 billion for public works projects, although it could take several weeks to disburse the money. Roxanne Miller, a lobbyist for the city of San Jose, said that can't happen soon enough. Dozens of projects in San Jose are awaiting financing from the state's so-called Pooled Money Investment Account, including a $15 million traffic light synchronization project; $5.5 million for improvements to public trails; and several million dollars for affordable housing projects. With the state's finances in shambles, San Jose has had to front the money to keep many of those projects going, Miller said. But that can continue only for so long. \"We're getting to the point where everyone needs some indication, some certainty that the money will be there,\" she said. Miller added that a $10 million project to upgrade Highway 101 at Tully Road, scheduled to begin construction within months, will be put on hold if state infrastructure funds aren't unleashed soon. She called the successful bond sale \"a big deal for all of us.\" The state's move to freeze infrastructure funds was at odds not only with Schwarzenegger's stated priorities but with the federal stimulus package approved last month. Last week, the governor held a news conference to tout 57 projects in line to receive the first injection of federal stimulus dollars for transportation, totaling $626 million. Santa Clara County projects on that list include $33 million for a rehab of Highway 280 from the Cypress Avenue pedestrian over-crossing to Tantau Avenue, and maintenance of a stretch of Highway 35 near Los Gatos.",

    "sentence": "Mass. legislators put off debate on gas tax hike. \"We've been pretty clear. We need to get to the reform-related issues before we do anything else,\" said Rep. Joseph F. Wagner, D-Chicopee, the co-chairman of the Joint Committee on Transportation. \"The public wants to see what we are going to do to fix a system that is broken.\" The announcement came as the five-member board of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority is scheduled to meet 3 p.m. on Monday at Ludlow Town Hall. Although the authority on Monday is expected to vote to delay a toll increase in or near Boston, Wagner said he will ask board members to consider restoring tolls for passenger vehicles between Exits 1 in West Stockbridge and Exit 6 near Springfield as a way to generate money for maintenance of the western end of the turnpike. He said Monday's meeting would be an appropriate time and place for the board to weigh bringing back those tolls as well as a toll in West Newton that also was taken down in 1996, but as of Thursday, the issue was not on the board's agenda for Monday. The Boston toll increase was scheduled to take effect in two stages starting on March 29. The governor, Senate President Therese Murray, D-Plymouth, and House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo, D-Winthrop, and turnpike officials have agreed to use turnpike reserve money to ward off the March 29 toll increase while they negotiate a more comprehensive answer for the state's transportation financing shortfall. The authority had approved the toll increases last month, turning up the heat on legislators to act on a bill to boost the gas tax as a way to prevent the toll hikes. Instead, Thursday's agreement gives legislators some more time to weigh Patrick's bill for a 19-cent increase in the state's 23.5-cent gas tax. Wagner said there is no support in the Legislature for the 19-cent increase Patrick proposed in his transportation bill submitted last month. Wagner said he couldn't say how much of an increase in the gas tax that legislators might support. \"I get the clear sense that 10 cents may be too much,\" Wagner said. The western portion of the turnpike is a separate financial operation from the road east of Route 128. If tolls were reinstated between Exits 1 and 6, Wagner said, it would provide more money for maintaining the western end of the turnpike. \"The road is in a terrible state of disrepair,\" Wagner said. \"It's clear the turnpike doesn't have the revenues to maintain that road.\" Rep. Donald F. Humason, R-Westfield, said he would support restoring tolls between Exits 1 and 6 if the revenues are used to improve the western part of the turnpike. Humason said he is concerned, however, with the plan by legislative leaders to approve a reform bill next week while delaying a possible tax increase until sometime before July 1. Humason said there would not be enough time for the reforms to kick in and save some money. \"Put the reforms in place,\" Humason said. \"Let them stand for a year. Let them stand for six months. Give them a chance to work.\" The authority has lost $12 million a year since it eliminated tolls for passenger vehicles between Exits 1 in West Stockbridge near the New York border and Exit 6 at Interstate 291 in Chicopee in 1996, according to Mary Z. Connaughton, of Framingham, a turnpike board member. Connaughton said she supports reinstating tolls for passenger vehicles in Western Massachusetts to generate money for maintenance for that section of the turnpike. She also wants to reinstate tolls on that section of the road because tolls are set to increase in Boston and the turnpike extension in Boston. Connaughton said bringing back tolls between Exits 1 and 6 would also help assure that the turnpike from Route 128 westward becomes free of tolls in eight years. Under current authority plans, bonds are to be paid off in 2017 on the 123-mile western portion from the New York border to Route 128. Under state law, the tolls are supposed to be removed when construction debt is paid. Connaughton said she is concerned that the commissioner of the state Highway Department could refuse to accept the western end of the turnpike as a state road if it is in poor condition in 2017. Connaughton wants the turnpike authority on Monday to consider restoring tolls for passenger vehicles between Exit 1 and Exit 6. The western end of the turnpike is currently operating at a deficit of about $15 million a year if the authority spends what it should on bridge repairs, paving and other capital projects, according to a report by the state Transportation Finance Commission. The turnpike board's meeting on Monday will center around an expected vote to delay a big toll increase scheduled to take place in Boston and on the turnpike extension east of Route 128. The first stage of the toll increase will boost tolls from $1.25 to $1.50 at the Allston and Weston booths and from $3.50 to $5.50 at the Boston Harbor tunnels. A second toll increase, due to take effect July 1, will raise the tolls at Allston and Weston to $2 and the tunnel tolls to $7. Board members approved those toll increases to help pay off $2.2 billion in debt left from the $14.8 billion Big Dig, maintenance and capital improvements.",

The city got $478,000 from the MassDevelopment Cultural Fund and provided matching funds from unspent bond money, one Springfield official said. The window work is estimated at $750,000 and the lighting system at $250,000. \"The windows are not energy efficient,\" said Patrick J. Sullivan, city director of parks, buildings and recreation management. \"This project will end up saving money as well as making the building more comfortable for the patrons.\" The new lighting control system will enhance performances, Sullivan said. \"It is important to keep up with repairs of this building because it is really a strong component of economic development and supporting the arts in the city,\" he said. In 2004, Symphony Hall benefited from a $850,000 renovation project through a private fund-raising effort. Renovations included padding and upholstery on more than 2,600 seats, interior painting, a new rest room for women, and installation of a stage curtain, draperies and carpeting. Cynthia J. Anzalotti, president of Springfield Performing Arts Development Corp., which manages Symphony Hall and CityStage, said she is pleased that the work will now move forward. \"It is a city building and it's part of the community,\" she said. \"Every event we have there is for our community, and benefits our patrons, restaurants, bars, and everything downtown.\" She is optimistic that work will be completed by early September. The windows are leaky, let in cold and hot air, and adversely affect sound, she said, and the new lighting controls \"will make a vast improvement.\" Chad LaBumbard, technical director, said the current \"extremely antiquated\" lighting control system was installed 30 years ago. The new system is \"industry standard\" and will be easier to maintain and repair, he said. SPRINGFIELD - The city is seeking bids for two renovation projects at Symphony Hall with a total cost estimated at $1 million - to refurbish windows, and to replace a lighting control system installed 30 years ago. Bids will be opened on Thursday for a new \"theatrical dimming and controls\" system, and on April 10 for window renovations that include replacement of perimeter caulk, painting and repairs. The 97-year-old building at Court Square, is city-owned.",

Still, officials and residents said, the council's 9-0 vote is a welcome sign toward getting the former Chapman Valve site to thrive again. \"We've waited a very long time for this. We've looking forward to it being developed,\" said Susan M. Craven Soto, president of the Indian Orchard Citizens Council. Chapman Valve at Goodwin and Pinevale streets once was the world's largest manufacturers of all kinds of valves, including fire hydrants, and employed nearly 3,500 people. The plant moved here from Boston in 1874. Crane Co., of Chicago, bought the company in 1959 and closed it in 1988. The plant milled uranium at Chapman Valve in the late 1940s in a nuclear power project for the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, N.Y. The U.S. Navy cleaned the site and recent city tests have shown it to be radiation-free, officials have said. But the site also is likely to contain oils, asbestos and polychlorinated biphenyl, commonly known as PCB's, man-made organic chemicals banned in 1979, officials have said. Another problem is the discovery in the past few years of a series of underground tunnels and pits, prompting questions about the strength of the foundation. The Chapman Valve plant has been demolished. The city owns two parcels, or nearly 14 acres. The remaining 39 acres are controlled by private owners, including Crane Co., which still owns about half an acre, said Christopher J. Moskal, senior project manager with the city Office of Planning and Economic Development. The urban renewal designation lets the city begin negotiating with the 39 acres' owners, Brian M. Connors, acting city chief development officer, said before the meeting. The designation must be approved by the state Department of Housing and Community Development. Officials see that as likely in light of Gov. Deval L. Patrick in August announcing a program to speed the cleanup of former industrial sites in the state, including the Chapman Valve property.",

He is now negotiating to sell 30.23 acres to the city for conservation purposes while keeping 1.5 acres at the end of Nelson Street to build two single-family homes. The land has been appraised at $450,000, while he has signed an \"offer to sell real estate\" agreement with the city for $500,000. In December, the council granted Demers a zone change from industrial to Residential A on 31.7 acres there to build single family houses. Bissonnette told residents the city doesn't want to build a park on the conservation land. Some residents are concerned about increased traffic in the neighborhood if the land becomes a recreational area. \"This is not going to be a park. The idea is to keep it in its most natural setting,\" Bissonnette said. The City Council's Recreation Committee will hold a public hearing on the grant application on Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. in Council Chambers in City Hall. The mayor and city department heads also gave briefings on the Front Street reconstruction project, that has just begun, along with the upcoming Center Street reconstruction project, the CVS under construction at Hampden and Center streets, and construction of the bike path-canal park from Front Street near City Hall to Grape Street that should begin next month.",

Dexheimer said officers scoured the scene but were unable to locate the gun and there were no witnesses.",

    "sentence": "Western Mass. stargazers to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei. Meg Thacher, who teaches astronomy at Smith College in Northampton and lives in West Springfield with her husband and two children, is organizing her hometown's star party. It will be held Friday from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. at Mittineague Park. Everyone is invited to come, and anyone with a telescope should bring it along. April presents some interesting celestial scenes. \"Saturn looks really lovely at this time of year,\" Thacher said. Its rings are edge on, enabling sky-gazers to view the brightest of Saturn's many moons. On Friday, the moon is in its first quarter, a perfect time to observe the lunar landscape. \"You can really see the craters,\" she said. Just going outside and looking at the moon with the naked eye is one thing. It can be beautiful, and some details are evident. But add a telescope, and it's a whole new experience. \"The level of detail is amazing,\" Thacher said. If peering at the moon seems too ordinary, what about a nebula? The Orion Nebula is one of the closest star formation regions. Because it is so close to earth, it is a great location to see how stars are born and progress. \"It's several times the size of our own solar system,\" Thacher said. \"These are stars formed by dust and gas. The light is so strong that it can push away the dust,\" she said. Through the telescope, these formations are remarkable to view, she said. Other events in the region are scheduled for 100 Hours of Astronomy. The Springfield Science Museum will host \"Stars Over Springfield\" on Friday at 7:30 p.m. Amateur astronomer Michael Kozicki will speak on \"Saturn's Disappearing Rings.\" Members of the Springfield Stars Club will be on hand, and participants may gaze at the stars in the museum observatory and through telescopes on the Quadrangle green. The cost is $3 for adults and $2 for children. Amherst College's Wilder Observatory open house at 9 p.m. on Saturday will give people a chance to use the 6-ton Clark Refractor as well as smaller telescopes set up by the Amherst Area Amateur Astronomy Association. The association also will offer a free program, Safe Solar Observing on Saturday from 1 to 2:30 p.m. at the Amherst Common and from 3 to 4:30 p.m. at A2Z Science and Learning Center in Northampton. Stargazing at the Sofinowski will take place sunset to 9:30 p.m. on Saturday at the Sofinowski Land Preserve in Southwick. Stargazers throughout Western Massachusetts will be joining others across the planet this week in celebrating Galileo. The \"100 Hours of Astronomy\" program is part of an international celebration of the 400th anniversary of Galileo's work. From Thursday through Sunday, astronomers, amateur astronomers and anyone interested in stars and planets will gather to point telescopes skyward. The goal is to get as many people throughout the world to look through a telescope as Galileo did. Advancements by Galileo Galilei, born in Italy around 1564, include making significant improvements to the telescope and astronomical observation, discovering moons of Jupiter, and defending Copernicus's theory that the Earth revolved around the sun, in contrast to the teachings of the Roman Catholic church. He died under house arrest ordered by the Roman Inquisition.",

    "sentence": "Local health care providers banding together to help poor, uninsured. In the years that area health care leaders have struggled with how to care for the uninsured -- while limiting unnecessary use of hospital emergency rooms -- the problems have only gotten worse. The 2008 economic downturn rendered many jobless, without insurance and without the extra cash for medical care. Without coverage for routine doctor visits, the uninsured often wait to seek preventive care and medical treatment until they're very sick, requiring costlier care in ERs. Others use ERs as their source for primary care but can't pay the bill. Hospitals make up that uncompensated care in other areas by charging more or eliminating some services. Here's a local snapshot. - Springfield hospital emergency room visits by uninsured Greene County residents grew from 17,709 visits in 2003 to 33,760 visits in 2007, the latest compiled data available. - The most common reasons for those ER visits by the uninsured were dental pain, dental/respiratory complaints, respiratory/lumbar, throat problems, alcohol/neck sprain/respiratory, and ear complaints. - The Kitchen Clinic saw 2,000 patients in 2008, or 8,000 patient visits, and turns away hundreds of people every month for lack of providers. It gave more than 47,000 free prescriptions, up from 42,000 the year before. - CoxHealth system provided $33.5 million in bad debt and charity care in fiscal year 2003, $64.3 million in 2006, and by 2007 it increased to $93.6 million. In 2008 it rose by another 13 percent, to $105.9 million. (Calculation for charity and bad debt is based on write-offs from patient charges.) The combined emergency department and urgent care visits for Cox North, South and Walnut Lawn rose from 145,000 in fiscal year 2007 to 151,000 in fiscal year 2008. The Cox ERs, alone, saw 104,000 patients in 2008. -St. John's Health System write-offs for bad debts and charity combined was $93.4 million in fiscal year 2006, $117.6 million in fiscal year 2007, and totaled $144.1 million in fiscal year 2008. (This increase is due to an increase in the number of uninsured patients and an increase in the number of insured patients who have not met the patient portion of their co-payments and deductibles.) One out of every five patients who visit the ER does not carry insurance. St. John's ER visits totaled 87,600 in fiscal year 2008, representing a 3.6 percent increase over the fiscal year 2007 ER visits of 84,500. Source: Springfield hospitals, Springfield-Greene County Health Department \"We all provide a significant amount of coverage for the indigent ...\" said Kim Day, president and CEO of St. John's Health System and a commission member. \" ... The economic times, combined with the fact that funding to safety-net providers is drying up, has frankly caused us to work harder, together.\" \"The commission's public-private partnership with the community is not a substitute for state or national reform,\" Day said, \"but we hope our efforts will increase access to health care services for vulnerable people, improving health outcomes in an unhealthy state and region, and reduce costs in the long run.\" It's patterned after the successful St. Louis Regional Health Commission, recognized nationally for helping coordinate existing services and money to boost primary care and dental visits among the city's working poor. It's one of about 10 U.S. city initiatives having success increasing access, reducing chronic health problems and cutting their hospitals' charitable care load, Bradshaw said. A board is spearheading the commission, including Day, Edwards, Gipson and Miller, Brian Fogle with The Kitchen Inc., John Lilly with the Greene County Medical Society, and Paul Taylor, CEO of Ozarks Community Hospital (formerly Doctors Hospital of Springfield). Others will be added from government, business and the community. In St. Louis, a financially troubled group of primary care clinics consolidated with a Jordan Valley-style community health center. The once-strapped clinics became eligible for federal funding, patients had access to more federal services like disease management, and the money saved was used to hire more health care providers, Fruend said.",

(Donna Baxter / for the News-Leader) Logan Elementary was formed in 1952 when eight eastern Greene County rural districts consolidated. High school students had a choice -- Rogersville or Springfield. Two years later, seven rural Christian and Webster County districts consolidated into Rogersville. In 1965, Rogersville voted to annex to Logan. A new high school was built in southeast Greene County. All grade 7 and 8 students -- who up to that time had attended the two elementary buildings -- were moved into the old high school in Rogersville. The elementaries remained separate until 1983 when the district was reorganized. K-5 students attended Logan and grade 6-8 students went to Rogersville. After several subsequent reorganizations, Logan-Rogersville has five campuses (including the Logan building) with a population of nearly 2,300.",

PARIS — Scott Randall threw up and cried when he saw the mobile home ravaged by a fire that killed four children. \"The whole house was gone, especially the living room,\" he said. \"It looked like an explosion blew out the wall.\" Nathan Skaggs, 2; Patrick Snelling, 8; Breonna Snelling, 10; and Cassandra Karg, 10, died in a fire at 2:46 a.m. Saturday, March 21, at 11690 U.S. 36, Lot No. 15, in the St. Paris Court West mobile home park, just west of St. Paris, according to the Champaign County Sheriff's Office. Phillip Skaggs Jr., 33; Christina Gregg, 33; and Natalia Skaggs, 8-months, escaped. They were treated at Mercy Memorial Hospital in Urbana and released, according to a sheriff's office news release. The relationship between the children and the adults was not described, although Randall said Karg lived down the street and was visiting for the night. Randall lives at Lot No. 5 and has known the family for about six years. The family moved into the mobile home a few months ago and the children are good friends with Randall's son. \"I still don't know how to break it to my son,\" Randall said. Brandyberry stopped by their home Friday night, ate some cookies and talked with them. They were supposed to meet up again this morning at Kiser Lake to fish. Breonna Snelling did well in school and Patrick Snelling loved sports, he said. \"They are good kids ... They are the cutest little things,\" he said. Brandyberry visited Gregg at Mercy Memorial Hospital on Saturday morning. \"Those kids were her life. They would go without for their kids ... She is so scared she can't even hold her own little baby,\" he said. The mobile home had electrical problems, shocking people who touched parts of it, Randall said. The cause of the fire remains undetermined, said Shane Cartmill, public information officer for the Division of the State Fire Marshal. An electrical engineer will examine the mobile home for additional testing on Monday, Cartmill said. \"We have not ruled out electrical as a possible cause,\" he said. Tabitha Roderick, 15, was sleeping across the street at her grandmother's home at Lot No. 51 when the fire started. \"My grandmother came in and woke me up,\" she said. \"I came out and all I could really see was smoke and flames and the fire trucks. It looked like it was really bad.\" She had played with the children a few hours before the fire. The boys played football, and Roderick and Breonna Snelling made rhymes. Tammy Danner lives at Lot No. 7 and found out about the fire from a phone call at 4 a.m. She often saw the children riding their bikes or playing outside while waiting for the school bus in the morning. \"It's awful, this is terrible,\" Danner said. \"I can't even imagine it being one of my boyfriend's kids ... It could have been any one of these trailers.\"",

According to the police report, the teens said they were walking near the intersection of Fair Street and South Lowry Avenue when a man approached them. After initially asking them for change, the man reportedly said, \"Give me everything you got!\" then struck the 17-year-old across the face. The teen who said he was struck told police he realized the man had hit him with a gun, so he ran. The man with the gun reportedly then demanded the 18-year-old place his wallet on the ground. When he did so, the robber picked up the wallet, which contained $15, and fled northbound on South Lowry Avenue, according to the police report. The report noted that the teen who said he was struck had visible swelling on the left side of his face.",

    "sentence": "Ohioans slow to receive stimulus money. Megan Gildow brings you the latest from the offices, halls and classrooms of local schools. Washington — By most measures, the $787 billion economic stimulus bill that President Barack Obama signed into law in February appears to be positively flying into the hands of state and local governments. Each week, the administration announces new formulas and new releases of funds, followed by a flurry of press releases from congressional offices touting the newest stimulus dollars in your neighborhood. According to those releases, the state has been approved for money for dilapidated National Guard armories, for hospitals to treat vulnerable populations and to spruce up crumbling highways. For a federal bureaucracy, it's as close to lightning-speed as it gets. But what the state actually has in hand is far less than what the press releases suggest. So far, the state has received just a fraction of the funds it's been notified that it will receive. The money it has received includes a little more than $388 million for Medicaid and a few million dollars for food for Ohio's aging population. \"It's out there,\" promises Dennis Evans of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, who said the state has been notified it will receive $298 million more in the months to come. \"It all depends on when the feds start laying it out there for everyone.\" In some cases, the grant process is all that's keeping the money from flowing. Communities getting grants on a formula basis have often been notified of their share of specific programs, but have to apply to get the funds. That's the case with the Edward Byrne Justice Assistance Grants. When doled out, those will give $61.6 million to the state. In the case of the federal highway transportation funds allocated this week, much of the money has to go through the state budget process before it can be spent. The state will pay for the projects and then be reimbursed by the federal government. \"Obviously our goal is getting this money invested in the economy as soon as possible,\" said Amanda Wurst, a spokeswoman for Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland. Described as a short-term shot of cash, the money will actually be sent out over the next two to three years, going through some 24 state agencies and, in some cases, going directly to counties and cities. The state announced earlier this month that it would receive $8.5 million for the Ohio National Guard — money to repair and update antiquated armories, including updating plumbing in Middletown. Mark Wayda, a spokesman for the Guard, said it expects to receive the wire transfer \"within the next couple of weeks.\" That they have to wait for a few more weeks, he said, is nothing – the Guard has been wanting to do these repairs for years. \"This money will give us the opportunity to fix a lot of things that have been broken that we have just not been able to get to,\" he said.",

XENIA — The girlfriend of the alleged drug dealer who hanged himself in a Georgia jail last summer after being snared in a nationwide manhunt agreed Monday, March 30, to a plea deal that should spare her from prison. Chelsie D. Hornsburger, 21, pleaded guilty to two counts of money laundering in Greene County Common Pleas Court. In exchange for her testimony against other members of a drug ring allegedly led by former Yellow Springs resident Umoja Iddi Bakari, prosecutors recommended she receive probation. The charges, both third degree felonies, carry a maximum sentence of 10 years. Hornsburger admitted to collecting drug debts on Bakari's behalf, two of which were $1,000 transactions with members of the Greene County Drug Task Force, according to court records. \"This is a good example of how someone who is naive can be sucked into a drug enterprise,\" said Suzanne Schmidt, first assistant prosecutor. Hornsburger also admitted to receiving drugs through the mail for Bakari and mailing drug payments to Arizona and California. Hornsburger met Bakari in 2007 and he told her he was a single dad. She later learned he was still married and operating a drug operation that brought marijuana and cocaine from Columbus to Yellow Springs for distribution, according to officials. Prosecutors also have indicted Bakari's wife, Bekelech M. Asefa, 26, of Canal Winchester, Ohio near Columbus, who faces 20 felony counts including racketeering and money laundering. She entered a not guilty plea to the charges earlier this month and is free without bond. Bakari fled the Columbus area last May before police raided several homes he owned there and arrested Hornsburger. Officers caught up with Bakari near Atlanta in June, but he hung himself with a T-shirt in jail shortly after his arrest. Police are still searching for Robert McDonald Jr., a former Greene County resident, who allegedly helped Bakari sell drugs. McDonald is wanted on 11 felony charges and also has lived in Atlanta and Florida, police said.",

NEW MIAMI — After a year of relative order, the village of New Miami is reeling again after a recently-resigned council member was arrested following an incident at the mayor's residence. Patricia Moore, 62, of the 100 block of Howman Avenue, was arrested at her home Wednesday afternoon, March, 25, and charged with criminal trespass and aggravated menacing, according to the Butler County Sheriff's Office. Moore allegedly tried to push her way into the home of New Miami Mayor Patti Hanes, according to police records. Hanes, 41, also of Howman Avenue, provided a statement to Butler County deputies indicating Moore was trying to gain entry to cause her physical harm. Moore was taken to the Butler County Jail where she was later released on her own recognizance. According to the narrative of her arrest, when deputies arrived at her home Moore held out her hands and said, \"I did it all and let it be noted when I get out I will find her and kick her ...\" Moore was among those who took the oath of office in January 2008 to fill several vacant positions on the village council. Moore said she resigned from her position a few weeks ago because of \"personal problems with the mayor.\" Moore said her family is intertwined with that of Hanes, but declined to comment further about the situation. Hanes also declined to comment about the incident. She said council is reviewing candidates to fill the seat vacated by Moore. Moore is scheduled to appear April 9 in Hamilton Municipal Court.",

PARIS — While hundreds of mourners paid their last respects to Cassie Karg and three other children who died in a recent trailer fire in St. Paris, Cassie's father mourned the loss in a prison cell in Orient, Ohio. Family members, prison officials and funeral home staff provided different stories about why Ricky Karg Jr. was unable to visit his daughter one last time before she was buried last weekend. Karg, who is serving a sentence on charges of receiving stolen property and failure to comply, was told of his daughter's death during a visitation period on March 23, about two days after the fire, said Jackie Rutherford, his sister and Cassie's aunt. While the family and the funeral home requested that he be allowed to visit his daughter, the request was eventually denied, she said. Instead, she said, Karg wrote a letter that was placed in his daughter's casket during a viewing Friday. \"He's not a hardened criminal and I think he should have had a chance to see his daughter,\" Rutherford said. The public viewing was scheduled to take place at Graham Middle School, but the correctional facility's policy prohibits inmates from visiting schools, said Angela Hill, a public information officer at the reception center. The facility also tried to schedule a private viewing, Hill said, but prison officials were not able to do so because the funeral home was unable to provide a specific time when the casket would be available. \"Because there were so many factors, we weren't able to make the arrangements, which had to be done in advance to allow (Ricky Karg) to get to a private viewing,\" Hill said. But Dave Vernon, director of Vernon's Funeral Home in Urbana, said he tried to work with the state and the family to coordinate a special visit, going as far as offering to transport the casket to Mechanicsburg, where it would be closer to the Correctional Reception Center in Orient where Ricky Karg. Jr. is incarcerated. \"It wasn't a matter of scheduling on our behalf,\" he said.",

Purdin, 71, drove the Springfield City Area Transit Villa Road route for the last time on Thursday, March 26, joined by his family. He will retire effective today, march 31, after 35 years working for the Springfield Bus Co. In his time, Purdin has seen a lot of changes. The first buses he drove lacked wheelchair lifts, window defrosters and air conditioners. In summer, drivers kept the doors open to stay cool. He enjoyed his relationship with the riders and his colleagues. \"I got to talk to people every day and I like people,\" he said. \"Throughout the years, I met all kinds of people.\" Purdin once drove presidential candidate and former U.S. Sen. Bob Dole around Ohio when he chartered a bus. \"Every time we stopped the bus, you had guys standing there from D.C. and they had these big guns,\" Purdin said. Rhonda Moore has worked with Purdin for 18 years. She didn't know if she would like him. On her first day driving alone, he yelled at her for a bad parking job. \"But he's a big softy, he's been fun,\" she said. \"He's like a big kid.\" Purdin likes to go all out and dress up for holidays, said Michelle Taber, SCAT operations manager. \"He was always on time, always here and always had a smile on his face,\" she said. He intends to travel to Hawaii and drive to Florida. \"I love driving,\" Purdin said. \"That's a bus driver's holiday — to drive.\"",

Springfield, Ohio — Butler Tech has been able to maintain high student achievement with low per-pupil costs by marketing to make sure seats were filled and eliminating spending that did not improve student achievement, CEO Bob Sommers told Springfield residents Monday, March 31. Sommers was the first of three finalists for the next city schools' superintendent to spend a day meeting staff, business leaders and the community as the final round of interviews for the position. He has been with Butler Technology and Career Development Schools since 2001 and by clearly defining and communicating goals, the school has reached new levels of success, he told the audience at Monday's open forum at Springfield High School. \"It's a focused attention to detail,\" he said. \"It's making sure that faculty and staff are given the opportunity to think and make decisions for student achievement.\" Questions at the forum focused on fiscal accountability as well as how Sommers, who has been superintendent of only Butler Tech, a joint vocational district, would handle new challenges like early childhood and elementary education at Springfield . Sommers said that he saw two major problems for Springfield: a need to improve student achievement and regain \"marketshare,\" or students who are going to charter, voucher and open enrollment options. \"There is no reason that Springfield City Schools cannot only regain its marketshare, but also become the premier place where you turn to go to school,\" he said. Sommers said that he would focus on putting systems in place that allowed staff to make the best decisions to improve student achievement while engaging the community in conversations about what a successful education in Springfield should look like. \"From my perspective, that's a question that the community answers and I deliver,\" he said.",

Muscogee County school board members James Walker and Pat Hugley-Green will keep their seats, while local business owner and parent Norene Marvets will be District 7's new representative. In the District 1 race, incumbent Pat Hugley-Green collected 4,782 votes, Mary Walker got 2,204 votes, and Christopher Seldon received 568 votes. In the District 3 race, James Walker gathered 4,225 votes to challenger Duane Melvin's 1,902. In the District 7 race, Marvets received 2,478 votes, and opponent Ryan Newbern collected 1,756 votes. This is the second time Walker has beaten out Melvin for the school board's District 3 seat. The two ran against each other in 2004. Tuesday night, Walker collected about 69 percent of the vote. \"I feel great,\" he said after the race was called by the Ledger-Enquirer at about 9 p.m. He said he was out to win, but that the race was not about him  it was about the children. \"I love what I do,\" Walker said. \"I do it for the children.\" Both candidates campaigned on improving student achievement and preparing for the students expected after the U.S. Army relocates the Armor School from Fort Knox, Ky., to Fort Benning. Growth due to the Base Realignment and Closure is expected to bring about 6,500 students to the Muscogee County School District. \"We will continue to help the schools get better,\" Walker said. \"We only have a few schools that are not making AYP.\" Walker, a retired insurance agent, has served on the board for 14 years and is currently its chairman. Melvin is a retired Army major who works as a unit manager in the Stewart County Detention Facility in Lumpkin, Ga. Hugley-Green collected about 63 percent of the vote. Challengers Mary Walker and Seldon received 29 percent and 8 percent of the vote, respectively. Hugley-Green has been on the board for one four-year term. During her tenure on the board, she has helped get pay raises for all employees, campaigned to rename Eastway Elementary as Lonnie Jackson Academy and fought to build a new Rigdon Road Elementary School. Walker is a real estate broker and former educator who ran against Hugley-Green in 2004 and lost. She taught at Reese Road and Claflin elementary schools. Seldon is an electrical contractor who has volunteered as a coach, mentor and tutor at the YMCA and Clubview Elementary. In the District 7 race, Marvets gathered about 58 percent of the vote. Newbern received about 41 percent of the vote. The incumbent, Joe Roberson, did not seek re-election. Marvets is the mother of six children and has been involved with area schools as a PTA president and as a member of the MCSD Sex Education Committee. She and her husband own John Paul Jeweler's on Warm Springs Road. Newbern is a student at Chattahoochee Valley Community College. He moved to District 7 to help care for his grandmother and works in sales for Knology. After he receives his associate's degree in liberal arts from CVCC in the spring, he plans to attend a four-year college. The board's District 5 seat also was up for election this year, but candidate Rob Varner, vice president of Synovus Securities, ran unopposed as incumbent Fife Whiteside did not seek re-election. The new representative will join the board in January 2009.",

Democratic incumbent Linda Pierce has secured the office of Muscogee County clerk Clerk of Superior Court, beating Republican challenger Reba Rae by more than 26,000 votes. Pierce received 47,876 votes, or 69 percent of the vote. Rae received 21,049 votes, or 31 percent. \"It's a very humbling thing to be elected again,\" Pierce said. \"I'm very grateful to the voters and I promise I'll do the best job possible.\" Pierce, 56, has held the clerk position since 1989. Before taking office, Pierce spent time in the Air Force and as an attorney in private practice. Her first job was as a congressional aide. The Muscogee County Clerk of Superior Court is in charge of keeping the county's records  criminal, civil and real estate. The clerk also keeps records for the State and Juvenile courts. The clerk communicates with all parts of the court system and is often the first stop for many encountering the courts. The clerk's office is located on the second floor of the Columbus Government Center. Over the next few years, Pierce said she wants to continue delivering excellent customer service and preparing for the future  namely, through efforts to make her office completely paperless. Her office has worked toward moving real estate documents online and providing help via e-mail. Rae, 55, currently serves as a deputy clerk in the Harris County Clerk's office. She has been in a clerk's office for about 20 years in Muscogee and Harris counties.",

    "sentence": "Election Day voting lines are smooth sailing. Voters turned out early and in force Tuesday on both sides of the Chattahoochee River, helping spread out election crowds and keeping lines relatively short as the day wore on. \"It was a lot busier this morning than in the past election, but I don't ever remember there being a slowdown like this in the afternoon,\" Sharon Ware, polling manager at the Blackmon Road Middle School precinct, said about mid-afternoon. Approximately 600 voters had moved through the lines there by that time. Volunteers at several voting precincts in Columbus reported 50 or more voters waiting for them in the dark to open their doors at least an hour before the official poll starts polls opened. Matrid Perdue, chief inspector at the Central Activities Center precinct in Phenix City, estimated more than 100 were in line as her polls precinct opened at 8 a.m. EST. \"They were from the front door all the way down the sidewalk to the street,\" she said. There were no problems, Perdue said, with nearly 1,800 votes being cast at the precinct by about 4 p.m. She predicted the total there might reach 2,200 before the day was done. \"We have had no disgruntlements,\" she said. \"Everyone's been very, very nice. No one has complained. No one has fussed.\" Part of the heavy morning turnout in Phenix City may have been caused by fact that because Alabama does not have advance voting like Georgia. Alabama also still uses paper ballots that are tallied electronically by voting boxes. Columbus election officials said last week that more than 38,000 voters in the city had cast votes early. The city's voting system is completely computerized. Mac Jones of Phenix City, after casting votes voting with his wife, Rosie, said he expected lines to be long there. He was pleasantly surprised at the smooth flow despite the crowds coming and going around him. \"Perhaps it is Barack; everybody's excited about that,\" Jones said of the enthusiastic turnout for an election that pitted Barack Obama, the nation's first black major party presidential candidate, against John McCain, whose running mate, Sarah Palin, was vying Tuesday to be the country's first female vice president. \"It's going to be history one way or the other.\" One of the largest opening crowds appeared to be at Rothschild Middle School. When poll manager Sandy Dowdell drove up to the school at 5:30 a.m., he was surprised to see about 50 people standing in line. Some of them brought folding chairs and blankets. By the time the precinct opened at 7 a.m., there were about 250 in line, he said. From 7-10:30 a.m. things were very the precinct was busy, he said. But election planners had many tools an answer to ease the crunch. \"People were saying how orderly and organized it was,\" Dowdell said. \"There were a lot of first-time voters. I know there were three 18-year-olds voting for the first time. Their mothers brought them.\" Because the voter turnout was predicted to be huge this year, each precinct set up queue lines similar to those at amusement parks.",

    "sentence": "Hyles unseats Turner for Municipal Court Judge. Columbus attorney Stephen Hyles has unseated Municipal Court Judge Haywood Turner. According to unofficial vote totals, Hyles had 61 percent of the vote to Turner's 39. Hyles finished with 42,600 votes to Turner's 27,058. \"I intend to work hard to make sure the people who supported me are glad they did so,\" Hyles said. \"I intend to work to earn the support of those who did not support me and hope to earn their support so they will support me the next time.\" By the time the results were final  after 1 a.m.  Turner had left his campaign headquarters and was unavailable for comment. This was the first time that Turner has faced opposition since he was elected unopposed two decades ago. Hyles, a defense attorney, was on Columbus Council from 1986-93. He ran unsuccessfully for mayor in 1992, when Bobby Peters was elected for his first of two terms. Hyles geared up his campaign to take advantage of early voting, and it appeared to pay off with a big advantage in the votes cast before Tuesday. \"There has been a paradigm shift in the election process,\" Hyles said. \"Nov. 4 is no longer the election day. It is only the last day to vote.\" Prior to the election, Turner admitted he was surprised that a challenge came from Hyles. \"There is no inference to suggest he is anything other than a good man,\" the judge said. \"He is more civilized than I and deserves a court with a higher jurisdictional limit.\" Turner has been in the news a number of times, most recently in April 2007 when he was accused of pointing a gun at another motorist. He was convicted of reckless driving, a charge that was reduced from pointing a pistol at another. He was sentenced to 12 months on probation, fined $1,000, ordered to perform 40 hours of community service and required to attend an anger management class. At the time, the police report stated that Turner said the gun was in its holster when he held it up. Today, he says he never pointed the gun at the other driver. He waved an empty holster, he said. \"I never brandished a gun,\" Turner said. \"I did not even own the type of gun described.\" In August 2002, Turner was in the middle of a pay dispute with Columbus Council. He was reluctant to issue a $625 fine to a California man for speeding, fearing that the money would likely be \"wasted\" in the hands of the city. That same morning, when a citizen complained about city inaction over a traffic signal, Turner turned up the volume by suggesting that setting off \"a nuclear bomb atop the Government Center\" might be the only way of getting Columbus councilors' attention. He later apologized for the remarks that angered city officials. In the aftermath, Turner's salary was raised from nearly $72,000 to almost $90,000. Today, the Municipal Court judge's job pays about $105,000 annually. Both men ran a clean campaign. Hyles has steered away from making a campaign issue out of Turner's behavior, declining to mention it at any campaign forum, debate or function.",

In a race that first appeared too close to call, Columbus' advance votes look as if they've catapulted challenger Julia Fessenden Slater into the District Attorney's Office. Democrat Slater, 42, took 71,445 votes, or 56 percent. Incumbent Republican Gray Conger took 55,486 votes, or 44 percent. Those numbers include precinct returns and in-person absentee voting in Columbus. Throughout the six-county circuit, 92 percent of the vote had been counted as of 1:30 a.m. today. \"We remained very encouraged,\" Slater said about watching the poll numbers come in. \"It was a bit of a roller coaster. It was a very energetic atmosphere.\" All precincts from the six counties in the Chattahoochee Judicial Circuit had not yet come in as of 1 a.m. today. Slater is an attorney in private practice. She worked in the District Attorney's office for 10 years before becoming a defense attorney. Slater had said she wanted to run for the office because she saw a need for change and because she was approached by various people who wanted her to run. Conger, 62, was appointed district attorney in 1995 and first elected to it the next year. He's served in the office since 1973. He's had opportunities to run for other positions but said he wanted to remain on the third floor of the Columbus Government Center where the district attorney has its offices. Conger had said he wanted to continue in his job to oversee high-profile cases such as the Doctors Hospital slayings and the double homicide in Harris County. Also, he has plans for slight personnel changes, perhaps shifting employees to different positions. Conger had said he feared some of his employees wouldn't have stayed in the office if his opponent won. He pointed to a recent murder case with three defendants prosecuted by an assistant of his. Conger said that case was beyond the ability of 90 percent of prosecutors, and he didn't want to lose employees like that.",

    "sentence": "‘The Fish Man' gets his own place. When Ernest Shivers stands over a vat of frying fish, good things happen. How else do you come to be known as “The Fish Man” by people from as far as Texas and Washington, D.C.? Shivers has spent more than a decade traveling to festivals and football games around the country, where he unhitches a trailer and goes to work frying up croaker, whiting, perch and pretty much any other good-tasting seafood he can find. Now, he's going full time with a restaurant that opened this month on White Street about a mile east of downtown Rock Hill. Shivers hopes customers at the new joint, called Ernie's Place, will learn the reason behind his nickname. “People line up just to get that fish,” Shivers said. “They like my cooking. I think it's just God's gift, because my ingredients really aren't that complicated.” At 57, Shivers is ready to do what he enjoys after a life spent in various jobs. He's driven a truck, fixed cars and worked in textile mills. But the need to fry has never left him. Dressed in white slacks, a chef's hat and a red apron and bandanna, Shivers looks as at home in the kitchen as Tiger Woods on the 18th hole at Augusta. It has been this way since Shivers was 16, cooking his own dinner every night while he earned his GED. “I was just meant to be a cook,” he said. “I tried all kinds of things, but cooking stuck with me.” Any owner will tell you that running a restaurant is a grueling business. The building on White Street has changed hands a number of times over the years. But Shivers says he'll get plenty of help from his wife, Thomasenia, and son Shaune, 26, who helps with the cooking and is said to make a mean peach cobbler. Shivers has already proven himself to an audience with high standards, said friend A.C. Jamison. That would be the students and alumni at Columbia's Benedict College. They flock to The Fish Man's trailer every year at the annual Harambee festival. Jamison, the father of former University of North Carolina basketball star and NBA standout Antawn Jamison, stopped in for a cheeseburger one afternoon last week. He knows Shivers through the Elks Club, where they both are members. Turns out, they don't call Shivers “The Burger Man,” but he makes those pretty well, too. At Benedict, Jamison said, they know the difference between a real cook and a pretender. “If you don't know what you're doing, you won't get invited back,” he said. “When it comes to food, they don't play. If they don't like something, they'll let you know.” Aside from seafood and burgers, the menu at Ernie's Place includes turkey wings, hot dogs and hush puppies. Monday brings the rib plate special, with beef stew not far behind on Tuesday. But the fish, Shivers hopes, will keep them coming back. The secret lies in the mix of spices and breading that he uses to coat the fish before dropping them into the fryer. So what's the recipe? “I don't give that away,” Shivers said. “Somebody will try to duplicate it.” Like a magician, “The Fish Man” doesn't reveal his secrets.",

    "sentence": "Firefighters battle Tega Cay fire. TEGA CAY  Local fire departments battled a blaze at a Point Clear home at 9:30 this morning. The Tega Cay Volunteer Fire Department and Flint Hill Fire Department responded to the blaze, which began in the master bedroom and was contained to that area, according to Tega Cay Fire Department Chief Scott Szymanski. The entire second floor of the home suffered significant smoke damage, Szymanski added. Alexis Butler, a 2000 graduate of Fort Mill High School, was the only person home at the time of the fire. Butler was sleeping in the master bedroom when she awoke to smoke filling the room. She said she saw a small fire and tried to put it out with a glass of water she had beside the bed, but quickly realized the fire was spreading too quickly for her to extinguish. She rushed out of the home and called the fire department. The fire was extinguished by approximately 10 a.m., officials said. The cause of the fire is believed to be electrical, Szymanski said. After the fire was out, firefighters spent the morning tossing debris out of the shattered master bedroom window, searching for any “hot spots” that might remain in the home, Szymanski said. Butler and her family, including her mother Diane Butler, who owns the house, will stay with her aunt, Susan Grubb, who also lives in Tega Cay. As Alexis Butler stood on her neighbor’s lawn, surveying the damage caused by the fire, she wondered aloud about the condition of her clothes, which were inside the bedroom closet. “Can you get the smoke out of clothes?” she asked.",

    "sentence": "State lawmakers say cigarette tax hike likely. COLUMBIA -- The sometimes-fierce nine-year battle over raising South Carolina's lowest-in-the-nation cigarette tax could end quietly this month. S.C. House Republicans and Democrats think they have a plan both sides can support to increase the tax. The plan is modeled after an Oklahoma program that uses cigarette tax revenue to secure matching federal money. That federal money then is used to provide a subsidy to buy health insurance for low-income residents or small businesses that could not afford insurance. “It looked like Oklahoma found a way to include the federal match,” said House Speaker Bobby Harrell, the plan's author. “That is critical to making sure there is enough money in the fund to cover a large number of uninsured people.” Last year, the House and Senate approved a 50-cent-a-pack increase. But disagreement over how the money would be spent meant the House could not override Gov. Mark Sanford's veto. If approved by the federal government, the House plan would raise the state cigarette tax by 50 cents a pack, raising about $147 million. That money, matched about 2-for-1 with federal Medicaid money, would provide tax credits to employers worth about 75 percent of the cost of buying health insurance for their employees. \"This is a compromise between people who want something tax-neutral and those folks who want to expand Medicaid,\" Harrell said. Additionally, about $5 million a year would pay for efforts to help people quit smoking. The state currently provides no money to help pay for smoking-cessation efforts.",

    "sentence": "Local officials making priorities for stimulus money projects. From an improved U.S. 21 bridge over the Catawba River to more guards at the county jail, local government officials are pursuing federal stimulus money for a host of priorities. Some are road widenings aimed at easing traffic or kickstarting multimillion dollar private developments. Others are described as urban renewal efforts to help neighborhoods with high crime rates move toward stability. Because so many places are competing for dollars, there is uncertainty over which requests will actually get money. “You can imagine all the other cities and counties doing what we're doing,” said York County Council Chairman Buddy Motz. “Everybody is scrambling to try to get some of the funds. We just need to make sure we're in the line.” In many cases, the projects have been on the books for months or years, but sufficient money hasn't been available. One example is the U.S. 21 bridge over the Catawba River. Local leaders have long wanted to replace the famously narrow two-lane bridge, where drivers can come within inches of each other as they pass. But plans call for more than just a new bridge. Under an agreement between Rock Hill, Fort Mill and York County, the new version would get pedestrian and bike lanes, light poles and a new façade aimed at making it a more distinctive feature. Supporters say the enhanced bridge could be a landmark along Interstate 77, and a popular attraction for hikers and kayakers along the Catawba River, where the Carolina Thread Trail runs through York County. Other projects have a more direct connection to spurring private investment. A private group planning a $600 million redevelopment at the old Celanese site has said Cel-River Road must be improved before it can move ahead with its plans. The proposed Riverwalk development will house one of the biggest industrial parks in the Charlotte region, along with a shopping center similar to Birkdale Village in Huntersville, N.C., and hundreds of homes and townhouses. It will take 10 to 15 years to complete, but officials say an improved Cel-River Road is the key to getting started. “It overshadows all the rest of them,” said Rock Hill City Manager Carey Smith, in terms of economic impact and job creation. “It allows that industrial park to take off.” The top priority is the S.C. 5 Bypass widening, which would widen the road from S.C. 5 west to S.C. 161. An estimated $19 million is needed to complete the project. Other projects are listed, along with cost needed to complete them: Roads aren't the only items on the list. County leaders also hope to use stimulus money to hire corrections officers at the Moss Justice Detention Center. The county has already hired 16 officers, but needs another 31 to man the expanded facility. Beginning corrections officer cost the county $43,743 in salary and benefits per year. “You can imagine, this is about the worst possible time to be adding 31 people,” County Manager Jim Baker said. “If we're relying on our own resources, it'd be very difficult. We'd either be faced with not opening the facility or potentially pulling some of our deputies from the street.” The path to securing stimulus money is anything but direct, with various pots of dollars available in different places. Legislation approved by Congress makes money available in education, technology, law enforcement and infrastructure. The Rock Hill school district would use stimulus money to replace funding that has been cut by the state, said Harriet Jaworowski, associate superintendent for instruction. Rather than launching new initiatives, the money would be put toward existing needs, such as tutoring programs. Some stimulus money could go directly to neighborhoods. For example, Rock Hill wants $180,000 to help build an asphalt trail connecting the Hagins-Fewell neighborhood to downtown. On the Saluda Street corridor, where revitalization efforts have been under way for years, officials are seeking $250,000 to create a gateway entrance at the S.C. 901 intersection. Plans call for a monument sign and landscaping to greet drivers entering Rock Hill's south side from I-77. Meanwhile, the county might pursue money to create a summer work program for youth. With entry-level jobs now being taken by adults, high school and college students are expected to have a tougher time finding work when school lets out. Included in the stimulus package is money to put youths to work picking up litter, making repairs to public buildings and doing office work. Baker heard about the work program in a conversation just last week, and asked his staffers to look into it. It's emblematic of how this unprecedented process is playing out – the people in charge are learning as they go. “As soon as we hear about an opportunity, we're trying to evaluate it,” Baker said.",

Cash to pay for 10,000 bells has come from a number of organisations including the St Nicholas Arcades and Marketgate shopping areas in Lancaster and Morecambe’s Arndale Centre. Crime prevention officer Jan Brown, says: “The bells are a simple but effective way of crime prevention and they were an extremely popular item last year. “The jingle bells are just one of a range of measures in place this Christmas to help keep people who live and work locally and their property safe. “This simple initiative decreases the risk of becoming a victim of theft by increasing people’s awareness. The bells are not only a deterrent for thieves, but they also act as a reminder to secure your wallet or purse. If you can hear the bell ringing then your purse or wallet is not secure enough and you need to put it at the bottom of your bag with the opening securely fastened.”",

    "sentence": "'Syria pressuring Cyprus over Iranian arms ship'. The EU and Syria are engaged in a tug-of-war over an intercepted ship suspected of transporting explosives from Iran to Palestinian terrorists in Gaza, European diplomats said Wednesday. The Cypriot-flagged Iranian arms ship Monchegorsk anchors off the Cypriot port of Limassol. Photo: AP The US military said it could not legally detain the ship, which it said was headed for Syria. The vessel continued on to Port Said, Egypt, and then on January 29 docked in Cyprus, where its cargo - described by Cypriot officials as material that could be used to manufacture munitions - was offloaded. The Cypriot government says the ship breached a UN ban on Iranian arms exports. A government official from a country in the region told the AP that Ghufari's delegation \"was instructed to reach secret agreements with Cyprus\" that would allow the Syrians to receive at least part of the cargo at the Syrian port of Latakia. Two Cypriot government employees familiar with Ghufari's visit could not confirm that, saying the subject was not broached at least in formal meetings the Syrian official had with his Cypriot hosts. Cyprus, with its nearest coastal point only less than 100 kilometers west of Syria, has traditionally been close to the Arab world. But the Greek-majority island is geographically part of Europe and joined the European Union in 2004, a move formally aligning it with the 26 other nations of the bloc.",

    "sentence": "Analysis: PA officials welcome failure of Schalit talks. Some Palestinian Authority officials in Ramallah have welcomed the failure of the prisoner exchange negotiations between Israel and Hamas as good news. Palestinian women attend a protest held by the Islamic Jihad movement calling for the release of prisoners jailed in Israel. Photo: AP \"I know several Palestinian officials here who were happy to hear that the talks between Israel and Hamas had collapsed,\" he said. \"They were concerned that such a deal would embolden Hamas and undermine the credibility of Fatah.\" The reopening of the crossings, especially the Rafah terminal, would only help Hamas tighten its grip on Gaza, the official pointed out. \"We must not forget that Hamas seized power in the Gaza Strip through a military coup [in 2007]. As such, Hamas is not a legitimate authority there,\" he said. The PA was also worried the release of hundreds of Hamas operatives to their homes in the West Bank would have created a big headache for its security forces. The PA would have preferred to see many of the Hamas prisoners and their families \"relocated\" to other areas, such as the Gaza Strip. Hassan Salameh, Ibrahim Hamed, Abdullah Barghouti, Abbas a-Sayed and Jamal Abu al-Hija were behind one of Hamas's deadliest military infrastructures in the West Bank. As experts in preparing various types of explosive devices, they are responsible for the killing of hundreds of people during the second intifada. Abbas's aides are not worried as much about the parties that would be held for the released Hamas prisoners as about the high probability the released men would rebuild their movement's military infrastructure in the West Bank and resume terror activities not only against Israel, but also against the PA. The crackdown, PA officials explained, was a preemptive measure designed to thwart any attempt by Hamas to extend its control to the West Bank. As far as these officials are concerned, the tough anti-Hamas measures are \"working.\" Today, there's almost no such thing as a Hamas political or military leadership in the West Bank, since most of the movement's prominent figures are either in Israeli prisons or in Abbas's detention centers. Another PA official said the only way to \"minimize the damage\" resulting from a prisoner exchange deal with Hamas was by persuading Israel to release a large number of inmates as a gesture to Abbas and Fatah. He said it would be a \"disaster\" for Abbas if Israel released important prisoners such as Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti in the context of a deal with Hamas and not Fatah.",

The occupant was out of the house when firefighters arrived. Flames were showing in the basement, and were knocked down in about 10 minutes, Keefe said. Much of the house was damaged by smoke and water. The fire appears to have begun in the laundry room, Keefe said. The cause is under investigation.

MINNEAPOLIS -- A federal judge has dismissed all claims against the Department of Homeland Security over an immigration raid at the Swift & Co. meatpacking plant in Worthington. The U.S. attorney's office says Judge Joan Ericksen dismissed the claims last Friday. The lawsuit was filed by 10 people who claimed their constitutional rights were violated during the Dec. 12, 2006, enforcement action dubbed Operation Wagon Train. The raid followed a 10-month investigation into the alleged use and distribution of fraudulent identity documents by Swift employees in six states. Immigration agents arrested 239 people on immigration violations in Worthington, out of a total of more than 1,200. Twenty of them were also charged with identity theft or related counts. Ericksen ruled that the government's search warrant established a sufficient basis for questioning the workers about their citizenship, and that the agents were entitled to detain people who were present there.",

Paris and Roxton continue to reap sales tax benefits from the construction of natural gas pipelines through Lamar County and a compressor station near Howland. Paris showed a 22.83 percent increase in January sales tax collections compared to a year ago and Roxton showed a 48.84 percent increase, according to a report on March sales tax distributions Friday by Texas Comptroller Susan Combs. Local entities receive half of the sales taxes collected on materials purchased for the pipeline with the municipalities where purchases are made receiving half. Both Sun Valley and Toco showed gains in March distributions on taxes collected in January. Sun Valley’s March check for $5,039 was up 15.92 percent from March 2008 while Toco received $4,365.75, an increase of 18.88 percent. Combs delivered $433.4 million in March sales tax payments to Texas cities, counties, transit systems and special purpose taxing districts, down 0.6 percent compared to March 2008. But for the calendar year, local sales tax allocations remain up 2.2 percent compared to the first three months of 2008. “State sales tax collections declined in February as important sectors such as retail trade and construction continue to struggle,” Combs said. “While state sales tax revenue has grown 2.8 percent through the first half of fiscal 2009, further declines are expected as the economy continues to weaken.” Paris collected $597,667.29 in March based on January sales taxes compared to $486,559.61 in 2008. Year to date the city has received $2,104,006.98 compared to $1.623,427.54 in 2008. (See accompanying chart.)",

A rumor spread across Northeast Texas through text messaging  warning people to stay away from Walmart because a gang initiation is supposedly going to take place involving the killing of three women in a Walmart parking lot  has no credibility, according to Paris Police Department officials. “As far as we can tell, it sounds like a hoax,” said Matt Birch, PPD crime prevention officer. “There’s no reason to stay away from Walmart.” The PPD said in a release that some people in the community, mostly young people from what the police department has been able to establish, received the message and passed it on to others in the community. The text message does not specify a particular Walmart, so each community thinks it is the store in their community, the release stated. “We do not believe the text message is factual,” Birch said. “They are getting hit all over the Metroplex with it. It’s a Northeast Texas thing, not just a Paris thing.” Also, Birch said another reason to doubt the authenticity of the message is the fact that gang initiations are not usually publicized events. “Gangs aren’t going to advertise their initiations,” Birch said. The police department was alerted to the text messages on Wednesday. Birch said law enforcement agencies in the DFW Metroplex area are investigating the source. The PPD then informed the Paris Walmart store and stepped up extra patrols as a precaution. “Although several Paris residents did receive the text message, at this time we have no reason to believe this is a valid threat to the Paris Walmart or to our local community,” the release stated. Birch said city dispatch has been inundated with calls about the message. “We do not believe the text message is factual,” the release stated. “Please discount it if you receive questions regarding it.” Dallas media stations reported the same message as a hoax as early as Wednesday night, and the message has also been reported as a hoax in other states across the country.",

Jessica Kay, 18, of Paris died Saturday in a Dallas hospital from injuries received in the Friday night collision involving a Ford Bronco driven by James Barnes, 20, of Paris and a Toyota Camry driven by Christina Boren, 28, also of Paris. Kay, along with two other passengers in the Bronco and the driver were transported to Paris Regional Medical Center before Kay was transported by helicopter to Dallas. Boren also was transported to the hospital. A three-year-old passenger in the Boren vehicle, seated in the center rear, was not injured, according to Paris Police Department public information officer Matt Birch. All other accident victims were treated and released. According to police reports, the Ford Bronco was traveling north on FR 1497 at Loop 286 when it collided with the Toyota Camry, which was westbound on Loop 286. Reports indicate the Bronco failed to yield right-of-way and was struck in the westbound lane of Loop 286. Barnes was cited for failure to yield right of way, Birch said. The accident remains under investigation.",

    "sentence": "Council looks over ‘to do’ list. Paris City Council asked the city manager to expand an 18-to-24-month bullet point strategic business plan presented at Monday night’s council meeting out 10 years and to meet with Paris Junior College president Dr. Pam Anglin and Chamber of Commerce president Pete Kampfer for assistance. The plan has been a point of contention between City Manager Kevin Carruth and some council members for the past year. District 6 Councilman Edwin Pickle was first to question the brevity of the plan followed by Councilman Steve Brown. The District 4 councilman said he was not consulted for input as referenced by Carruth’s statement in the council package that “most council members did not indicate a particular preference in format or content, however the consensus was a simple bullet of to do’ list that would cover the next 18-24 months and could be utilized in planning for the FY 2009-2010 budget.” “I guess I am not part of the consensus, so it doesn’t matter,” Brown said. Pickle asked council members directly, “I just want to make sure there was a consensus and we are happy with a simple bullet or to do’ list,” Pickle said. District 7 Councilwoman Rhonda Rogers said themanager’s plan “is an adequate beginning.” “I think we continue to develop a plan 10 years out,” she added. Rogers also expressed concern that she saw nothing from any departments about what is in future plans to address services to outlying areas, particularly for those taxpayers who have requested disannexation because of lack of city services. “I didn’t see what the different departments are going to do toward helping them with whatever city services they feel like they need,” Rogers said. “We’ve got to make them feel like they are part of the city.” Pickle recommended, as he said he had done in the past, that Anglin be consulted to help on the strategic plan. “Dr. Anglin agreed and expressed a desire to help work on a strategic plan for the city  not for PEDC; not for the Chamber; not for the county,” Pickle said. Mayor Jesse Freelen agreed that bringing Anglin into the equation “is not a bad idea at all.” Some long-term planning is needed but not necessary in every area of every department, District 2 Councilman Kevin Kear said. He cited airport development, wastewater treatment and water delivery as “some big infrastructure I think we do need to have a general plan about where we are going.” Freelen agreed that long-term planning in those areas would give future councils some type of guidelines as well as serve as a measurement tool to show “where we have been and where we are going.” Although Brown said he would have liked to have the bullet list presented Monday “18 months ago,” the councilman added, “From this you look at it and then you make your strategic plan. I like that  at least we have a start now.” Freelen asked Carruth to schedule a meeting with Anglin and Kampfer and to make regular reports on the planning process. In other business the council: received a favorable outside audit report for fiscal year ended Sept. 30 2008; rejected a disannexation request from three property owners; cancelled a May 9 election for unchallenged Districts 4, 5, and 7 incumbents; took favorable action on a Trail de Paris extension as well as a United Way early learning project on the trail; and, discussed the possibility of adding 10 hangars at Cox Field, estimated to cost $480,000. Council then spent a little more than an hour in executive session before reconvening the meeting and adjourning shortly afterwards. Pickle said prior to the meeting he had requested an executive session to discuss what is expected of the city manager, mainly in regard to the strategic planning process. Also in executive session, the council was to receive information about an incentive offer to a business prospect.",

    "sentence": "Commissioners hear from TxDOT on bridges. Texas Department of Transportation representative Richard Harper told Lamar County Commissioners Monday TxDOT has simplified the bridge repair process for counties, making it easier and quicker to begin work on matching funds projects. Harper said the list of structurally deficient bridges in Lamar County eligible to be replaced in the federal program can be speeded up if the county provides the paperwork involved in the matching funds process, but the county no longer has to wait months on the paperwork to begin its own work. “The process has been shortened to allow work to begin much quicker,” he said. Harper said TxDOT has provided the county with a current list of 16 structurally deficient bridges. “All the county has to do now is submit its list of bridges it will repair as matching funds for the bridges TxDOT will repair or replace,” Harper said. “As soon as that is done, the county can begin work on those projects, and the state can begin work on the structurally deficient bridges.” In other action, commissioners issued a resolution formally approving the application to the Office of the Attorney General, Crime Victims Services Division for funding for the office of Lamar County Victim Witness Coordinator for the years of 2010 and 2011. The court also hired Ginger Cook of Funding Solutions to perform grant writing services for the 2009 Assistance to Firefighters grant for the Lamar County Volunteer Fire Departments. Lamar County Elections Coordinator Russ Towers asked commissioners to approve a licensing agreement with election Systems & Software, Inc., that would allow the county to print its own ballots in cases where the ballots are running short in any election. Commissioners approved the software licensing, training and hardware at a cost of $4,870. Towers said the move would ensure the county never runs short of ballots. Denise Dority of Resource Management & Consulting Company was given the right by the court to advertise for materials for water line replacement through the Texas Community Development Block Grant Small Towns Environment Program. Commissioners also approved Hayter Engineering for services for the rural Community Affairs Community Development Program projects, and awarded administrative services to Resource Management & Consulting Company. Commissioners also declared the month of April “Fair Housing Month” in the drive for equal housing opportunities. The court set the time to demolish and remove the Hickory House building at 35 Graham Street at 8:30 a.m. April 1, when commissioners will bring their equipment to the site and erase the building. Commissioners also: received a certificate of completion from the County Judges and Commissioners Associa-tion of training for Commissioner Lonnie Layton; approved official bond and oath for Brandi Taylor as deputy clerk in the office of the Lamar County and District Attorney; approved a line-item transfer for Constable Gene Hobbs, moving gasoline funds to a capital account for the purchase of a vehicle; heard County Treasurer Shirley Fults’ report for the month of January and a quarterly investment report; and, heard County Auditor Kevin Parson’s report for January.",

By Bill Engle Staff Writer March 27, 2009 Luminous Electronics Recycling, a Denver-based company, was near announcing plans to open a new facility in Richmond, promising a $1.5 million initial investment in an existing building with hopes of hiring 50 to 70 workers within three years. “We’ve actually identified a facility and negotiated a lease,” Luminous company president Steve Fuelberth said Friday from Denver headquarters. “But part of our plan was to be able to access what the state of Indiana had to offer. “Once the program was dropped it caused us to step back and re-evaluate the exact location of that facility,” he said. The Indiana Department of Environmental Management decided to stop funding the grant and loan program in January, saying that cash-strapped local governments and businesses might not be able to provide matching dollars. Valerie Shaffer, manager of business attraction for the Economic Development Corporation of Wayne County, said she is still working with company officials to bring them here but admitted “they were discouraged when they heard the grant program had been frozen.” Fuelberth agreed the deal is not dead but added that he will investigate incentives offered by surrounding states.",

Investigators say Jackson was beaten and strangled while in the Kenton County jail in Covington. Parker is awaiting trial in the death of a man whose body was found under a bridge in January. Jackson was being held on a charge of giving false information to police in a separate case. Police are trying to determine the motive. The name of Parker's attorney was not immediately available. Jail and prosecutor's offices were closed for the day, and online court records did not include his attorney's name.",

    "sentence": "French filmmaker slammed for likening illegals to WWII Jews. France's immigration minister criticized a film director on Monday for likening the situation of illegal immigrants in France today to that of Jews under the Nazi occupation during World War Two. Director Philippe Lioret - whose film \"Welcome\" about illegal immigrants trying to reach Britain from northern France opens on Wednesday - has criticized a French law that makes it a crime to help illegal immigrants. \"To see that a decent guy can all of a sudden be charged and that he can go to prison is crazy. It feels like it's 1943 and we've hidden a Jew in the basement,\" Lioret told the regional newspaper La Voix du Nord last week. Some 76,000 Jews were arrested in France during World War Two and taken to concentration camps such as Auschwitz, where most died. Those found to be hiding Jews faced a similar fate. Immigration Minister Eric Besson told Europe 1 radio that comparing the plight of Afghans in the northern town of Calais to that of Jews during the occupation was \"intolerable\", and that Lioret had \"crossed the red line\". \"I have the impression that the film's promoters are committing a deliberate slur, no doubt with the intention of increasing publicity for the film's release,\" he said. French President Nicolas Sarkozy has promoted a controversial tough immigration policy, which is widely believed to have won him the support of many far-right National Front voters in the 2007 presidential election. Sarkozy's policies include setting targets for police on the number of illegal immigrants they must expel each year. \"Welcome\" tells the story of a middle-aged lifeguard at a Calais swimming pool who, while trying to win back his wife's affections, meets a young Kurd and helps him swim across the Channel to Britain, where the young man's girlfriend lives. Vincent Lindon, who plays the lifeguard, has also spoken out about immigration policy in the run-up to the film's release, denouncing the often squalid conditions in which immigrants live while attempting to find a way into Britain. \"I believe we must respect human beings. The people in Calais are often treated worse than dogs. And I don't like that,\" Lindon told the newspaper Le Parisien in an interview published on Saturday. \"I do not understand that there is an article of the (law) that says: 'Any person who helps a person in an illegal situation is punishable by up to five years in prison'.\"",

    "sentence": "U.S. to spend $1m on accommodations for Mideast envoy George Mitchell. U.S. officials said Friday the State Department will spend about $1 million to renovate, reconfigure and furnish the Washington workspace of special Mideast peace envoy George Mitchell and outfit satellite offices for him in Jerusalem and in New York, where he lives. State Department spokesman Robert Wood said Friday that $27,000 has already been set aside to upgrade Mitchell's sixth-floor suite at the department's headquarters and that more money may be needed. Additional funding may be required for further work as staffing requirements and other needs are identified, Wood said. This reconfiguration and renovation is designed to enhance efficiencies and staff coordination for this very important mission. The cost of the other offices is still being determined, but officials say they expect the price for all three, excluding additional staff, to reach seven figures. Mitchell and his staff had been allocated rooms on the State Department's first floor near the offices of other special envoys such as Richard Holbrooke, Dennis Ross and Todd Stern, who handle, respectively, Afghanistan and Pakistan, Southwest Asia and the Gulf, and climate change. But officials said he wanted to be closer to the front office of the department's Near East regional bureau, which is located on the sixth floor and that the renovations were needed to adapt the available space there. Mitchell, the former Senate Democratic leader who negotiated the Northern Ireland peace accord, does not receive a government salary.",

Abbas said that \"any new Israeli government should reaffirm anew its commitment for peace by clearly accepting the two-state solution, the road map peace plan and all commitments reached in previously signed agreements.\" He also stressed that \"without (Israel) halting all settlement activities, in Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied territories, there will not be serious and productive negotiations.\" Abbas stressed that the Palestinians want to reach \"an effective truce\" with Israel that would end bloodshed and hardships. He called on Israel to stop the destruction of Palestinian homes in Jerusalem and elsewhere in the Palestinian territories, describing this policy as one of \"ethnic cleansing.\" Jerusalem Police on Saturday dispersed a number of small events staged as part of the Palestinian Culture Festival, meant to declare the city \"the capital of Arabic culture for 2009.\" As of Saturday afternoon, police had shut down eight events and arrested 20 people, believed to be the events' organizers. Nonetheless, Palestinian officials say they plan to hold several events throughout the year to commemorate Jerusalem as the capital of Arab culture. Related articles:",

    "sentence": "Peres to tell EU: Netanyahu will advance peace . President Shimon Peres launched a campaign a few days ago whose aim is to convince the international community that the \"Netanyahu-Lieberman-Barak\" government in the making will advance the peace process with the Palestinians. Meanwhile, senior European Union officials have sent messages to Benjamin Netanyahu making it clear that a refusal to adopt the \"two-state solution\" means freezing any upgrade in relations between Israel and Europe. Peres seeks to allay European and Arab suspicions about the Netanyahu government and the appointment of Avigdor Lieberman as foreign minister. The president has been helping Netanyahu in his coalition negotiations with Kadima and the Labor Party, and was party to the secret talks between the Likud chairman and his Labor counterpart, Ehud Barak. In a phone call late last week to mark the 30th anniversary of Israeli-Egyptian peace, Peres told Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak that the agreements signed by Israel contain an obligation to promote a regional peace agreement as well as separate agreements with each of Israel's neighbors. \"In addition,\" Peres said, \"the new government will be obligated to honor all of the international agreements that have been signed.\" Sources close to Peres said yesterday that the president has transmitted similar messages in his talks with foreign leaders, which are expected to continue through Wednesday, when the new government is to be sworn in. Peres is to make an official visit to Prague on Monday, where he is scheduled to meet with the president, prime minister and foreign minister of the Czech Republic. The Czechs are the current president of the European Union, and according to sources in the President's Residence in Jerusalem, Peres intends to take advantage of his visit to present the coalition agreements to his hosts and to stress the new government's commitment to the peace process. \"It will be one of the main topics of the visit,\" the source said. In addition, immediately after the swearing-in ceremony for Netanyahu on Wednesday, Peres will launch a media blitz of interviews to the foreign press to explain the policies of the new government.",

In the interview, Assad argued that Israel understands that the return of the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria during the 1967 Six-Day War, is not negotiable. \"The Israelis know that we are not going to negotiate the line of 1967,\" Assad wrote, but suggested that compromises were possible. \"We only demarcate the line,\" he wrote. \"We negotiate the relations, the water and everything else.\" ? You discuss everything after the peace and getting your land. Not before,\" Assad stressed. \"Hezbollah is in Lebanon and Hamas is in Palestine,\" Assad continued. \"If they want to solve the problem with Hezbollah they have to deal with Lebanon. For Hamas, they have to deal with Gaza. For Iran, it is not part of the peace process anyway. This peace is about peace between Syria and Israel.\" The Syrian president reiterated his stance that it was now, more than ever, \"essential that the United States play a prominent and active role in the peace process,\" explaining that Syria required direct contact with U.S. President Barack Obama in order to advance the diplomatic process. Assad also lauded the diplomatic efforts of former U.S. president Jimmy Carter, saying that \"Carter is most knowledgeable about the Middle East and he does not try to dictate or give sermons. He sincerely is trying to think creatively and find solutions that are outside the box.\"",

    "sentence": "Czech foreign minister 'not happy' with Israeli policies. The Czech EU presidency is not happy with some Israeli policies and an EU-Israel summit is unlikely to take place in the next three months, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said on Tuesday. \"We are not happy with some of the steps of the Israeli government, namely construction works close to Jerusalem but also access to Gaza, which is today very limited,\" daily Lidove Noviny quoted Schwarzenberg as saying. \"The new Israeli government has not raised much excitement either.\" Schwarzenberg said it was unlikely that the Czech presidency would hold an EU-Israel summit as earlier planned. Senior EU officials have sent messages to Benjamin Netanyahu making it clear that a refusal to adopt the \"two-state solution\" means freezing any upgrade in relations between Israel and Europe. International trepidation over the incoming government's righward orientation prompted President Shimom Peres to launch a campaign a few days ago whose aim is to convince the world that the \"Netanyahu-Lieberman-Barak\" government will advance the peace process with the Palestinians. In a phone call late last week to mark the 30th anniversary of Israeli-Egyptian peace, Peres told Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak that the agreements signed by Israel contain an obligation to promote a regional peace agreement as well as separate agreements with each of Israel's neighbors. \"In addition,\" Peres said, \"the new government will be obligated to honor all of the international agreements that have been signed.\" Sources close to Peres said yesterday that the president has transmitted similar messages in his talks with foreign leaders, which are expected to continue through Wednesday, when the new government is to be sworn in. Peres made an official visit to Prague on Monday, where he met with the president, prime minister and foreign minister of the Czech Republic. The Czechs are the current president of the European Union, and according to sources in the President's Residence in Jerusalem, Peres intends to take advantage of his visit to present the coalition agreements to his hosts and to stress the new government's commitment to the peace process. \"It will be one of the main topics of the visit,\" the source said. In addition, immediately after the swearing-in ceremony for Netanyahu on Wednesday, Peres will launch a media blitz of interviews to the foreign press to explain the policies of the new government.",

    "sentence": "Head of controversial Palestinian orchestra banned from West Bank camp . The head of a Palestinian youth orchestra who set off an uproar by performing a concert for Holocaust survivors in Israel was blocked Tuesday from entering a West Bank refugee camp because of concerns for her safety, a local official said. Security official Radi Asiba said the life of the orchestra conductor, Wafa Younis, would have been at risk if she remained in the area of the Jenin refugee camp. Younis, an Arab woman from Israel, led a small orchestra for Palestinian youths in the hardscrabble camp. But she fell out of favor with residents after taking the orchestra to play for the Holocaust survivors last week. \"When Younis tried to enter the camp on Tuesday, she was halted by a prominent local leader,\" Asiba said. \"We informed her that she is forbidden from entering Jenin because her presence causes tensions,\" he said. Younis struck a sensitive nerve. Many Palestinians are reluctant to acknowledge Jewish historical suffering because of concerns that it weakens their own claims to victimhood and to the land. Ignorance and even denial of the Nazi genocide during World War II are common in Palestinian society. Parents said they were not told their children would perform for the Holocaust survivors. Residents of the Jenin camp are descendants of the some 700,000 Palestinians who either fled or were expelled from their homes in the war that followed Israel's creation, an event Arabs call the Naqba, or catastrophe. They said they were angry with Younis because their children had performed for Holocaust survivors while Israel had not acknowledged the suffering caused to them. Younis was not available for comment on Tuesday but earlier said she only meant to spread goodwill through the concert. On Sunday, camp officials boarded up Younis' rehearsal studio and confiscated the orchestra's music instruments: an electronic keyboard, a few kamanjas - an Arab instrument that looks like a violin - and some small drums. Younis established the Strings of Freedom orchestra around three years ago in the Jenin refugee camp.",

Nearly 70 percent of Palestinian young adults believe the use of violence to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is not very helpful, according to a United Nations Development Program (UNDP) study released Tuesday. Only 8 percent believe violence is an important tool, the study, based on interviews with 1,200 Palestinians over the age of 17 in the West Bank and Gaza. The study also found out that more than 80 percent of young Palestinians are depressed, and 47 percent identify themselves as Muslim rather than Palestinian. It found that 39 percent were \"extremely\" depressed and 42 percent were depressed by their conditions. Depression was more marked in the Gaza Strip where 55 per cent said they were \"extremely\" depressed. When asked to define their identity, 47 percent identified themselves as Muslims, 28 per cent as Palestinians, 14 percent as humans and 10 per cent as Arabs. \"Young people are exceptionally vulnerable in a conflict situation. They are more likely to be injured, arrested or sucked into harmful situations,\" said Jens Toyberg-Frandzen, special representative for UNDP's Program of Assistance to the Palestinian People. \"At UNDP we have always understood that you cannot develop an economy or a nation without developing its youth, particularly when the economic and political environment appears to offer limited hope,\" he said. Unemployment rates for Palestinian youth range from 35 percent in the West Bank to 51 percent in Gaza, said UNDP. The survey of attitudes of Palestinian youth was part of a report commissioned by the UNDP and presented to a workshop designed to plan a strategy for youth development for the Palestinian Authority.",

    "sentence": "'He will not be forgotten,Kate, that I promise you'. The remains of Stephen Carroll are carried in Banbridge yesterday 'To the love of my life. I will never forget you. I love you now and always, Kate' IT was just after 1.20pm when one simple act illustrated the truly seismic changes brought about by the North's peace process. And then, in the middle of a Northern Irish town and watched by Protestants and Catholics alike, he walked behind the coffin of a murdered policeman. Twelve years ago -- when the last Northern policeman was shot dead -- such a public tribute by a southern policing figure would have triggered a riot. Most children watching the sad procession yesterday never knew what it was like to live with the almost daily torrent of bombings and shootings. They do now. Many had heard a police wife tell in a radio interview how their 12-year-old son tearfully begged his father not to go to work this week. He didn't want him to get shot. Some of those who once followed a violent path are now in the North's government. Some are not, but they still came to Banbridge yesterday. They faced the TV cameras and appealed for the killings to stop and said there was no popular support for the dinosaurs still wedded to the past. The requiem Mass for Mr Carroll brought together a remarkable coalition of former terrorists, police officers, church leaders and politicians of all hues. Banbridge also turned out in force to say goodbye. Thousands lined the three-mile route from Mr Carroll's home to St Therese's church. A three-minute silence was held in the centre of the town and then the cortege passed, 18 officers walking ahead of the hearse, six motorcycle outriders ahead of them. A piper played a lament called the 'Flowers of the Forest' and mourners wept as the hearse passed by. Amid the roses, carnations and lilies, a floral tribute had also been sent from England by the family of murdered soldier Sapper Patrick Azimkar. As well as cards from his own parents, son Shane, siblings and grandchildren, Mr Carroll's heartbroken widow Kate left her own simple tribute. It said: \"To the love of my life. I will never forget you. I love you now and always, Kate.\" Then, she watched as her husband's casket, clad in a PSNI flag, was borne into the church by six fellow officers. \"He will nor be forgotten Kate, I promise you,\" Mr Orde said, adding Mr Carroll (48) knew an unexpected violent act like this could one day happen given the hatred in some hearts. Canon Liam Stevenson, the Banbridge parish priest, told mourners the killing of Mr Carroll was designed to destabilise the peace process. The word patriot, he said, had been horribly abused. \"The killers of Constable Carroll have abused the term patriotism. \"A perfectly laudable aspiration such as patriotism is robbed of its intrinsic value when it's allied to violence and death in pursuit of its objectives.\" Bishop McAreavey ended by sending a direct message to the killers: \"You are greatly mistaken. Your way of thinking is backward looking. As soft rain began to fall outside, Bishop McAreavey's words were met by hope, tears and thunderous applause.",

The men, ranging in age from 18 to 23, were brought before Tipperary District Court yesterday on charges relating to incidents on March 17 last on Main Street and Abbey Street in Tipperary town. Three of the men were granted bail in open court -- despite objections from gardai who feared they would attempt to intimidate witnesses -- while bail hearings in relation to the other two were held in camera. The hearings held behind closed doors involved Patrick O'Keeffe (19) of 19 St Ailbe's Drive, Tipperary, who is accused of carrying out assault causing harm, assault, and two breaches of the Public Order Act and Jimmy Delaney (23) of 1 Carrowclough, Tipperary, who is also accused of a breach of the Public Order Act as well as assault causing harm and escaping from custody at Abbey Street, Tipperary, on March 17. Dan Delaney (18) and Ned Delaney (21), both of 1 Carrowclough, Tipperary, had been in custody since last week on charges of being intoxicated in a public place, using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour and assaulting or threatening to assault a garda carrying out their duty. John-Paul Delaney (18) of Upper Abbey Street, Cahir, is charged with assault, assault causing harm and theft of a mobile phone at Main Street, Tipperary, on the same date. The court heard that he was arrested after four gardai entered his address while he was in bed, during a major garda operation on Tuesday. Opposing bail in respect of Dan Delaney, John-Paul Delaney and Ned Delaney, Detective Inspector William Leahy said that there was \"a larger group\" of people who were involved in a number of incidents of intimidation over the last year. Following the incidents on St Patrick's Day, he had looked back over files of complaints, \"and a pattern has arisen where witnesses who made complaints about assaults either refused to make statements or, having made those statements, subsequently came into the garda station and withdrew them, and that's my fear today\". \"It's the State's contention,\" said Inspector Pascal Feeney, \"that over the past 12 months a number of injured parties or witnesses have withdrawn their statements as a result of intimidation and fear.\" The applications for bail were made by solicitors Vincent McCormack and Philip English. Judge Anderson said, in relation to the case involving Dan Delaney, that it was up to the State to stand up any evidence of past intimidation and, as they could not do this, he was precluded from refusing bail. The same applied in the other cases he heard in open court.",

    "sentence": "Mum denies making up child death story in deportation battle. Nigerian woman Pamela Izevbekhai yesterday insisted she had not fabricated a story about the death of her baby daughter in order to be allowed to remain in Ireland. Ms Izevbekhai \"totally rejected\" allegations that she manufactured the story to bolster her case against deportation. \"I did have a daughter Elizabeth and she did die as I said,\" said the Sligo-based mother who has been fighting a long-running legal battle against deportation. She has consistently maintained that her first daughter died at the age of 17 months after being subjected to female genital mutilation (FGM) and has argued that if the family is sent back to Nigeria her two younger daughters would be subjected to the same procedure. The mayor of Sligo, Veronica Cawley, yesterday stood by her decision to hold a civic reception for Ms Izevbekhai last year while a spokesman for the Sligo-based Let Them Stay organisation said yesterday's reports raised more questions than they answered. Cllr Cawley said some people had suggested that she should apologise for holding the civic reception but she insisted: \"I have nothing to apologise for.\" At that function in Sligo Town Hall, Pamela wept as she said that Elizabeth would always be with the family and was a guardian angel for her sisters Naomi and Jemima. Cllr Cawley urged people not to jump to conclusions until all the facts come out. \"I have always said that the purpose of the civic reception was to highlight the barbaric practice of female genital mutilation and today I repeat my call for a worldwide ban on this torture,\" said Cllr Cawley. \"Before Pamela came to live in the north west, most us had never heard of FGM but there is a huge awareness now.'' \"These reports are only a snap shot in a long-running investigation which is not over yet,\" said Cllr Cawley. Cllr Cawley said that while a number of people had gone on local radio yesterday saying she should apologise for holding a civic reception for Ms Izevbekhai \"everyone who phoned me today was supportive\". Supporters of Ms Izevbekhai pointed out that while Lagos-based obstetrician Dr Joseph Unokanjo was now claiming that he had never delivered a baby called Elizabeth Izevbekhai, and that he had never treated her for post-FGM blood loss, a doctor of the same name has in the past given interviews to RTE and Ocean FM in Sligo saying the opposite and supporting Pamela's account. They also pointed out that he is now saying that the baby he delivered for Pamela in 2000 was her first baby but she has a teenage son Adrian who lives with his father Tony in Nigeria. A spokesman for Let Them Stay questioned why this material had been leaked now and whether there was an agenda behind it. \"The safety of these two little girls should still be the main issue and I wonder is the Irish government saying that it is safe to send them back to Nigeria?\" he said. \"We would like to see Dr Unokanjo come on Irish radio again and see what he has to say now.\" He said supporters were concerned about why these claims were being made now, four years after Ms Izevbekhai first outlined her fears.",

ABSENTEEISM amongst the country's health workers has increased since last year, despite a clampdown on chronic sick leave crippling the health service. Monthly absenteeism bulletins are now being collated in a bid to curb the practice which costs the agency 150m a year in replacement staff. While sick leave rates are always expected to increase during the winter months, absenteeism rates will not be helped by the current pressures on health service staff, who claim they are overworked and under resourced. Despite the pressures on front line nursing staff, they take less sick leave than their colleagues in portering, catering, community welfare and other anicillary health services. Sick leave rates for nurses average at six per cent across the health service, compared to more than seven per cent for those in anicillary and general support services. The HSE has said that staff, including support staff, had to do a lot of manual work, which leaves them more prone to injury. Limerick hospitals recorded particularly high rates of absenteeism in several departments. The highest overall rates of absenteeism -- which cover all categories of staff -- for January were recorded in the following hospitals:",

    "sentence": "Council is accused as sewage kills fish stocks . SEWAGE is pouring into a river, decimating fish stocks, after a local authority ignored advice to cease allowing building on an overloaded system. Mayo County Council is sanctioning several major developments in a town, despite a warning from the planning appeal board that housing schemes should not be built until the capacity of the area's 70-year-old sewage treatment facility was improved. Ironically, a 25-house development turned down by An Bord Pleanala when it issued its warning was later granted planning permission by the council when a new application was submitted. However, no significant upgrade works on the sewage plant, which only provides primary treatment of waste waters, had taken place in the intervening period. The housing developments, a 44-bedroom hotel and a 315sq metre office building, were all sanctioned after 2000 when the board issued its warning. Although the council says it has now prioritised the upgrading of the sewage treatment plant, a row between the local authority and the Department of Environment over funding has delayed the improvements. Concerned anglers have questioned the council's planning policy and say untreated effluent is now flowing directly into the River Pollagh, a tributary of the River Moy. Before it became polluted, the Pollagh was renowned for brown trout fishing and was also an important salmon spawning river. \"It appears the council has favoured development over the environment and the past 10 to 15 years have seen the gradual decimation of fish stocks and fly hatches. \"The town can no longer avail of game angling facilities nor can we attract visiting anglers as we did in the past.\" Mayo County Council said in a statement that it was \"happy\" with its policy regarding planning in Kiltimagh. \"Serious questions need to be answered as to how almost 200 houses, a hotel and an office building could be given permission by the council after An Bord Pleanala voiced serious concerns about any future development in the town without adequate sewage treatment facilities being put in place,\" said",

    "sentence": "Viaduct on pace; steel is key. COLUMBUS -- The warmer temperatures are making the 33rd Avenue viaduct reconstruction workers’ jobs much easier as construction continues on pace to meet the contractor’s Nov. 3 targeted date to reopen the structure. The contracted deadline for the viaduct to be open to traffic is Dec. 5 with an incentive of $3,315 per day, up to 60 days, if the project is completed prior to the deadline. Penalties were also included in the contract for each day the viaduct was closed beyond Dec. 5. Dan Cramer, project manager for Cramer & Associates Inc., said the weather has provided better working conditions and hopes it persists. “It just makes the work a lot more comfortable and a lot more productive,” Cramer said. But, he said, this early in the construction the timeline does not provide a good indicator as regards when the structure will be completed. “These schedules don’t mean squat,” Cramer said. “When you see the steel show up, that’s when the schedule will mean something.” The support cables are already completed, but the timing is heavily dependent upon the delivery of the archway, which is being fabricated by Capital Steel Co. in Lincoln. Capital Steel “is currently working on it,” Cramer said, and as for delivery, “we are still shooting for early June.” The 10-foot-diameter, 96-feet-deep drill hole was completed by subcontractor Longfellow Drilling last week and the placement of the steel rebar cage and the concrete pour was completed by Cramer & Associates, the primary contractor for the $12.9 million contract for bridge removal and replacement, road work, concrete pavement, street lighting and new sidewalks. To date, the six pier support shafts on the north side have been completed and the remaining three are expected to be completed within the next two weeks, Cramer said. “We are moving to the south side,” he said, and the goal is to complete “one this week and two next week. The columns (are scheduled) to be poured consistently, one or two a week for the next month.” Removal of the north side was completed last week, which included excavation of the north side wall, Cramer said, and the erection of the north side retention wall, expected to begin this week, is a few weeks ahead of schedule.",

    "sentence": "Platte Co. tops 32K for first time. Census data released today show Platte County reaching an all-time population high of 32,072 as of July 1, 2008, an increase of 1.6 percent since the 2000 census. From 2007 to 2008, the population increased by 272 people, nearly a percentage point gain at .86 percent. The increase places Platte as the state’s 10th most populous county. Overall in Nebraska, not even a third of the counties saw populations increase in 2008. The figures show 28 of Nebraska’s 93 counties gained in population from July 2007 to July 2008. That’s one more than in the previous year. All but one of the remaining counties lost population. Sherman County, which includes Loup City, held firm at 2,994. But an analysis from the University of Nebraska at Omaha’s Center for Public Affairs Research shows changes overall were better than those seen in recent years. Small Hitchcock and Hayes counties in southwest Nebraska, for example, both gained population in the one-year period after several years of losses. “Maybe it’s a one-year blip or something, but it’s definitely interesting to see that,” said UNO’s David Drozd, a research associate. Dakota, Otoe and Washington counties, whose numbers typically go up, saw their populations fall. In December, the Census bureau reported the state gained 13,959 residents over the one-year period. That’s the most Nebraska has seen in a dozen years. Drozd attributed the gain to people moving into Nebraska from states harder hit by the economic downturn, as well as a strong birth rate. Economic conditions also could have lured some people back to rural areas, including college students who returned to the farm, he said. “By and large, for rural areas, a lot of the commodity prices were relatively strong,” he said. Several counties are seeing population levels unseen in decades. Lincoln County’s population (North Platte) of 35,582 is closer than ever to its all-time high set in 1981. It needs about 220 more people to top it. Some counties that marked losses in 2008 saw their rates of decline slowing. Madison County, for example, lost just 20 people after losing hundreds after the closing of a Tyson Foods plant in 2006. The combined population of Douglas, Sarpy and Lancaster counties continues to creep closer to the 1 million mark. They now account for 52 percent of the state’s population, having more than 931,000 residents combined. In 2000, they controlled nearly 49 percent of the state’s population. With the 2010 Census quickly approaching, the latest estimates confirm a timely change of course within Nebraska’s 3rd Congressional District. The district that includes more than three-fourths of the state lost about 2,700 people annually in the first six years of the decade. But in 2008, it gained about 150 people. Drozd estimates its total population now sits at 551,000. Every 10 years following the census, seats in the U.S. House of Representatives must be redistributed fairly among the states. In 2000, Nebraska’s slow growth sparked concern that the state could lose a seat a decade down the line. More than 70 years ago, Nebraska had six congressional districts. The House lost seats in 1933, 1943 and 1963.",

    "sentence": "City woman fined for false assault accusation. COLUMBUS -- A 27-year-old Columbus woman who admitted to falsely accusing a Meadow Grove man of sexual assault in May 2008 has been fined and ordered to pay restitution for lying about the incident. Janae McMahon was fined $150 and ordered to pay $1,671 restitution on Wednesday in Platte County Court for her conviction of attempted false reporting. McMahon pleaded no contest to the reduced charge in connection with the May 28 incident after recanting her story of a sexual assault stemming from an encounter with the man she met over the Internet. The defendant, who was initially charged with false reporting, successfully completed court-ordered mental health counseling prior to her sentencing. McMahon paid the restitution for the police and medical expenses of the assault investigation late last year. Platte County Attorney Sandra Allen said she hoped the sentence imposed on McMahon didn’t make law enforcement investigators “gun-shy” about making sexual assault arrests in the future. “On the face of it, (a fine and restitution) is not much of a deterrent to someone making a false accusation,’’ Allen said. On the other hand, people who falsely accuse others of crimes probably aren’t deterred by the threat of punishment, she said. Defense attorney Denise Kracl said Thursday McMahon’s successful completion of counseling, which her client began even before being ordered to by the court, was a factor at sentencing. The judge checked McMahon’s progress and compliance with counseling requirements over several months and was “very fair” in giving her that opportunity, Kracl said. “This has been a really unfortunate situation for everyone involved,’’ the defense attorney said. “Janae is resuming her life and doing the best she can to put the whole incident behind her. This is as good of an outcome as she could have expected.” False reporting is a Class I misdemeanor is punishable by a maximum of one year imprisonment, $1,000 fine or both and no minimum sentence. Attempted false reporting is a Class II misdemeanor is punishable by a maximum of six months in jail, $1,000 fine or both and no minimum sentence. The county attorney’s office dismissed a first-degree sexual assault charge against 38-year-old Richard Pehrson II of Meadow Grove in late-June. The man faced up to 50 years in prison if convicted. McMahon later recanted her story after Pehrson underwent a polygraph examination, and she was brought in by law enforcement authorities for further questioning. Pehrson was held for about a week in the Platte County Detention Facility following his arrest. His bond was set at 10 percent of $150,000 and he was placed on unpaid administrative leave from his job as a psych tech at Faith Regional Center in Norfolk. Pehrson, who also served as a volunteer firefighter, got his job back when McMahon’s lie came to light. Allen sent letters to Pehrson’s employer and the fire department explaining how he had been falsely accused in the case. “He was not terribly angry,’’ said Allen recalling a telephone conversation with the Meadow Grove man. “He was happy to have his name cleared.” Pehrson could not be reached this week for his reaction to his accuser’s sentencing. The Meadow Grove man and city woman, according to court documents, met over the Internet in early-May and were corresponding by e-mail for three weeks before the incident. The two met once in a public park in Norfolk. Later in May, Pehrson was invited by McMahon to Columbus late the night of May 27 to watch a movie. In the early-morning hours of May 28, Pehrson said the two had consensual sex. In the days following the incident, McMahon sent Pehrson e-mails saying how much she missed talking to him. That’s not the story McMahon initially told authorities. According to the arrest affidavit filed in the case by Columbus Investigator Gregory Sealock, the woman did invite Pehrson over to her home to watch a movie, but she later got tired and wanted to go to bed. The woman said she allowed Pehrson to sleep on her couch because he had been drinking beer and didn’t want to drive to his Meadow Grove home, Sealock stated. The woman later “awoke to find Pehrson in bed with her” and described a sexual assault in graphic detail. Defense attorney Donna Tonderum, who represented Pehrson while serving as a deputy in the Platte County Public Defender’s Office, said her former client felt “humiliated by the whole experience.” Tonderum said Pehrson was expecting McMahon to spend some time in the county lockup. “I think he’d be very disappointed by the outcome,” she said.",

    "sentence": "More rural residents self-employed. OMAHA -- A University of Nebraska sociologist says the state’s waning rural population is changing the way people do business. Randy Cantrell, with the university’s Rural Initiative, said in most rural counties, between 18 percent and 30 percent or more of jobs are now due to self-employment. And, that accounts for virtually all job growth in rural areas. He believes the popularity of self-employment is on the rise in rural Nebraska. Cantrell hasn’t been able to put his finger on such details through his research, namely an annual rural poll that surveys rural residents on well-being, policy and work issues. But he has a theory: The rural poll is asking the wrong question. In the past, people have been asked if they have a business. Cantrell realizes that may be leaving out those who still get a paycheck from their employers, but technically are private contractors. He used the example of inbound telemarketers, who he thinks can rightfully assert they have a business. As rural areas continue to see their population numbers fall, Cantrell said he expects that to put pressure on employers to shift away from the traditional way of doing business and rely on private contractors. “There’s still a demand for service but not enough to support a business of several employees,” he said. Cantrell details the phenomenon and other observations about Nebraska’s economic and demographic changes in a new report based on 2007 census data and other federal statistics. Census data released this week shows the state’s three largest counties ” Douglas, Lancaster and Sarpy ” grew by 14,240 people collectively in 2008. The remaining 90 counties declined by 281. Cantrell said he plans to revise his report with the newly released information. The rural poll will take another shot at the “business” question this year, which is on its way to 7,000 Nebraska households. The survey is conducted by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s Center for Applied Rural Innovation in cooperation with the Rural Initiative and UNL’s Department of Agricultural Economics. Cantrell’s study also notes the continued decline of those under age 20 living in rural areas. All but seven counties in the state declined in this population group during this decade, he said in the report. Cherry County, for example, saw a 20 percent drop in people under age 20 between 2000 and 2007. He attributes the changes to people leaving the state ” likely for economic reasons ” and a decline in birth rates.",

    "sentence": "Students from 9 schools join in music event. COLUMBUS -- Most of the student musicians had never met before, and they only had a few hours to get in harmony before they would be performing together. Students from the Nebraska Centennial Conference were at Scotus Central Catholic Saturday for the honor band and vocal clinic. Several dozen students from the nine conference schools spent the morning and early afternoon practicing songs for concert held at the school later that day. Scotus had about 30 students taking part in the band and vocal concert. Guest conductors lead each of the groups. Dr. David Bohnert, director of bands at Wayne State College, lead the band, and Dr. Rhonda Fuelberth, associate professor of music education at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, directed the choir. Students had been learning their respective music a few weeks prior to the clinic, but Saturday was their first time performing as a group. That is one aspect that Scotus Senior Nicholas Raimondo enjoys about the clinic. “We are all working together instead of competing against each other,” Raimondo said. Students also said another part that they like about the clinic is the opportunity to perform with different directors. The instructors each brought their own unique style to the clinic. Bohnert told the students as he was directing them during practice, that he wanted them to experience what it is like performing with a large and different group of people. “If you learn nothing else today, at least learn to listen. This is where we go from 70 different individuals to one band,” Bohnert said. “You have to put yourself in the big picture.” Students were chosen for the clinic by their instructors and by meeting certain criteria. The host site for the event rotates between the nine schools in the conference. E.J. Gardner, vocal music director at Scotus, said the arts, especially performing arts such as band and choir, help students develop into well-rounded people. “There is a music intelligence part of the brain, just like there is a math intelligence and a science intelligence. This is a way to feed the brain,” Gardner said of the clinic.

    "sentence": "Fiscal skills top Lakeview priority. COLUMBUS -- The Lakeview Board of Education met Monday with representatives from McPherson & Jacobsen LLC to establish the major criteria they are looking for in a candidate to replace Superintendent Paul Calvert. The Omaha executive recruitment and development firm presented the five-phase approach it uses to help school districts hire administrative staff as well as a tentative calendar that includes a seven-week timeline and May 8 as the estimated date for the final decision of the board. The first phase was conducted during Monday’s meeting as the board identified the five major criteria they are looking for in potential candidates. The top five skills and characteristics identified and ranked by the board, according to McPherson’s tabulations, are, in order: 1. Strong fiscal skills; 2. Good communication skills; 3. Open-minded leadership; 4. Good team member and leader; 5. Extensive knowledge of local, state and federal policiesThe representatives asked each board member to identify characteristics they would like in a potential hire. Of note, “the best quality education for the kids” was listed during the second time the representatives asked for each board member’s ideas, but was not included in the top five based on McPherson’s tabulation. After the list was compiled, it was condensed by consolidating overlapping criteria and each member was then asked to pick their top five and rank them in order. The application questions will revolve around the criteria identified, according to the McPherson representatives. Although honesty, integrity, respect and ethics were commonly listed by board members, Jerry Ehlers, lead consultant for McPherson & Jacobsen, said identifying factors for those characteristics were standard for each process. Ehlers encouraged the board to list criteria that would help them find a superintendent who would match the needs of the district and meet the challenges it faces. “It is understood if you are going to get the job you have to have those characteristics,” he said. Ehlers made the board aware the district could be competing with other districts for an exceptional candidate and cautioned them not to hire a replacement just to fill the position. “There just aren’t a ton of applicants out there. There are more people retiring and getting out of it then are coming through the pipeline,” he said, so candidates “are interviewing you just as much as you’re interviewing them. ”“If you don’t get a quality candidate because of the timing” he advised the board to move forward with an interim superintendent for a year, Ehlers said. “Mr. (Glen) Morgan and I aren’t hiring anybody, the patrons aren’t hiring anybody, the students aren’t hiring anybody. Only the six of you have a vote.” At the board’s request, Ehlers said the principal search to find a replacement for Bob Arp could be conducted for an additional $1,500, which would include advertising, recruitment screening and background and reference checks. The board tentatively set a special meeting for 11 a.m. Friday at Lakeview High School to discuss and vote on that proposal.",

    "sentence": "Couple found dead in condo. An elderly husband and wife were found dead Monday night in their downtown Hanover condominium in an apparent murder-suicide, authorities said yesterday. The bodies of Elliott Lewis, 84, and Barbara Lewis, 82, were discovered by two Hanover police officers, who responded to the complex at 85 S. Main St. after the couple's adult son grew concerned about their welfare and called the police. Yesterday, authorities released few details and said they were awaiting results of autopsies conducted by the state medical examiner's office, which should be released today. \"We have some preliminary assessments from people on scene, but it's inappropriate for me to say,\" Senior Assistant Attorney General Kirsten Wilson said during an afternoon press conference outside the Hanover police station. Authorities did say that soon after arriving at the condo Monday night, it was determined that only the Lewises were involved and that the public was not in danger. \"There are no outside forces,\" Hanover police Chief Nick Giaccone said. \"The community can rest assured that it is safe. It was fairly obvious from the beginning.\" Wilson declined to say if authorities had pinpointed who died first, a motive or a weapon, or if they had found a note at the scene. Authorities said they were interviewing the Lewises' neighbors and relatives yesterday. Giaccone said the Lewises had two adult sons and other family members scattered throughout the region and country. One of their sons, Spencer Lewis of Bethel, Vt., declined to comment yesterday when reached by phone. \"I am beside myself right now,\" said Spencer Lewis, a local singer-songwriter. Giaccone said the Hanover police had no prior contact with Elliott or Barbara Lewis. \"From the police perspective, they were not generally known to us,\" Giaccone said. The Lewises' 900-square-foot condominium is part of a 55-and-over complex adjacent to the CVS parking lot in downtown Hanover. The Lewises had lived in the building for about 10 years, Giaccone said. They were renters, according to Hanover Town Hall records.",

    "sentence": "Alleged assault victim lives with man's ex-wife. The man who claims that former Epsom police chief Henry Farrin assaulted him is the roommate of Farrin's former wife. Farrin, 43, was arrested March 11 on a charge of simple assault for allegedly attacking Howard Brown, 27, in the restroom of the American Legion Post 31 in Penacook. In a stalking petition filed with Concord District Court, Brown wrote that Farrin choked him and lifted him off his feet. When the charges were first publicized, neither the police nor Farrin's attorney, Tony Soltani, would say what the connection was between the two men. Since then, Brown has told the Monitor that he is a friend of Farrin's ex-wife. \"That's what I think his beef is with me,\" Brown said. Brown said he became friends with Farrin's former wife when he lived in an apartment next to the one where she was staying while going through her divorce. Brown later moved to a two-bedroom apartment and told Farrin's ex-wife that she could rent a room from him if she needed a place to stay. \"I never even sneezed in this guy's direction my entire life,\" Brown said. According to Brown's account, Brown, Farrin and Farrin's ex-wife were all at the American Legion, with separate groups of friends, on the night of March 6. Brown is not a member of the Legion, but he said he came with a colleague who is a member. Brown said he went to the bathroom, and Farrin walked in after him. As Brown was about to leave the bathroom, Farrin started speaking to him. \"All of a sudden I hear the guy say something: 'How does it feel to be a chump?' \" Brown said. \" (I said) 'Excuse me? If anyone's a chump, it's you.' \" Brown said Farrin walked toward him and asked Brown to repeat himself, which he did. \"He instantly looks at me, pins me up against a wall, picks me up off my feet,\" Brown said. Brown said he knew Farrin was a former police officer, so he did not hit him back, although he did insult Farrin verbally. \"I never touched him,\" Brown said. At that point, Brown said, a woman standing outside the door heard the scuffle and opened the door enough to see Brown pinned up against the wall. She called for help, and several men rushed into the bathroom and separated Farrin and Brown. Brown said he decided to file for a restraining order and press charges with the police because he was scared Farrin would one day hurt him or someone else. \"He's an ex-chief of a police department,\" Brown said. \"What's he doing grabbing a guy in a men's room? He called me a chump.\" Soltani said he plans to bring witnesses to contradict Brown's account and will try to discredit him.",

    "sentence": "Judge bars developer from sites. A Merrimack County Superior Court judge yesterday denied a request by Concord developer Kevin Guay to have access to his properties while state officials conduct a criminal investigation into possible environmental violations. Judge Diane Nicolosi wrote, \"the State's interest in maintaining the integrity of its crime scene and investigation warrants the temporary exclusion of Mr. Guay and his lawyer from the property until the search is completed.\" Nicolosi said the search warrant is similar to grand jury proceedings, which the court has recognized as being secret. \"It is in the public's best interest for the State to work at the site unfettered and to accomplish any necessary follow up without interference from the public or a criminal defendant,\" she wrote. On Thursday morning, the Concord Police executed two search warrants and cordoned off Guay's properties at 180 Clinton St. and on Villanova Drive. The Department of Environmental Services took soil samples and began excavating. A state helicopter was involved in the action. No one except for tenants was allowed on or off the property, including Guay. At 1 p.m. yesterday, Guay's attorney Brandon Giuda filed a petition with the court asking for access to the property. \"I'd think in the U.S., which is not a police state, observation of the police's extensive intrusion into someone's property, where they're destroying by excavating, should be observed,\" Giuda told the Monitor. \"We want to see what they're doing.\" At a hearing two hours later, Lauren Noether, senior assistant attorney general for the state Justice Department's environmental protection bureau, responded that Guay should not be allowed onto the property. She argued that his presence could compromise the investigation, jeopardize the safety of officers and be a health risk. During the hearing, several new details emerged about the investigation. Detective Sgt. John Thomas of the Concord Police Department's criminal division testified that officials started work at the Villanova Drive property, which they hoped to finish yesterday evening. They planned to start work on Clinton Street today, and hoped to finish by the end of the day. According to Noether, the warrant gave state officials seven days to finish their search, but Thomas said he hoped it could be completed by tonight. \"There's a lot of money involved from the city and the state,\" Thomas said. \"We'll try to finish tomorrow, but we don't know what's in there. If we find what we're expecting to find, it could be longer.\" On the Villanova Drive property, Thomas said there was a defined \"hot zone\" where the state had dug a hole and was removing hazardous waste, and from which at least one large item was removed yesterday. Noether said there were safety concerns, since state officials do not know what is buried. \"It's not entirely clear what's going to be exposed,\" Noether said. \"If it contains something like asbestos, it can be airborne.\" Noether described the area as \"one huge pit of junk\" that is being excavated by two Department of Environmental Services officials in protective gear. She also worried there could be something explosive, like a propane tank, buried on the property. Noether also said that the area includes a \"command zone\" where DES is communicating with the police, and communications could be compromised if someone else were present At the Clinton Street site, Noether said, one \"hazardous area\" was near the driveway, just past the police barrier, where there is a septic system and leach field. Noether said Guay would be allowed back on the property once state officials stopped digging and deemed it safe. According to a satellite picture of the property found through the Live Search Maps website, there is also a large pile of debris behind a barn on the Clinton Street property. Guay said yesterday that it was a pile of junk, which the city has inspected, and that it contained nothing hazardous. There are wetlands concerns on both properties, state officials said.",

The frozen body found earlier this week along the shore of Lake Opechee in Laconia has been identified as that of a Laconia man who went missing nearly three months ago. But the police still aren't sure how Bryan Harman, 28, died. The state medical examiner's office conducted an autopsy yesterday, identifying the body as Harman's. The autopsy found nothing suspicious - no wounds or signs of violence - and it could be months before toxicology reports come back, said Laconia police Capt. William Clary. \"There's nothing sticking out,\" Clary said. He said the autopsy also did not determine how long ago Harman had died, but \"we're saying at least several months.\" Harman was last seen on New Year's Eve. He had a fight with his girlfriend, his mother said when she called the police the next day to report him missing. The police began to investigate. Flyers were posted around Laconia. The police tracked Harman's cell phone and credit cards, but they weren't used, Clary said. Harman never picked up a paycheck from work. Months passed, and no one called to report anything, Clary said. On Wednesday, two people walking along nearby railroad tracks and searching the area for bottles spotted a body by the lake's shoreline. It was partly in the water and partly covered in ice, Clary said. The body, which was fully clothed, likely wasn't visible until recently, as snow began to melt, Clary said. The medical examiner's office took the body, and an autopsy was scheduled. Though an identification hadn't been made, Harman was the only missing person report that the Laconia police had pending, and they contacted his family to let them know a body had been found. \"We wanted to make sure they knew we were doing everything we could,\" Clary said. During the autopsy, the medical examiner was able to identify Harman with information his family had previously provided, including \"tattoos, body piercings, very good clothing description,\" Clary said. \"We had all that stuff on hand.\" Harman also had his wallet, including an ID from Alaska. Clary said Harman lived in Alaska \"for some period of time\" and said he thought Harman's father lived there also. Harman is listed as living on Dartmouth Street in Laconia. Yesterday morning, before the autopsy had been conducted, a woman answered the phone and identified herself as Harman's ex-girlfriend. She said she was \"assuming the worst.\" She said she hadn't heard from him since Dec. 31.",

The 60-year-old Alton man was diagnosed with leukemia in August and discovered that his form of the disease does not respond to typical cancer drugs. Instead, he requires a stem cell transplant - a procedure similar to a bone marrow transplant, except that only stem cells from the marrow are used. \"What initially seemed like a simple part of the whole thing, to find a donor, get a transplant, turned into the biggest hurdle of all of it,\" Chase said. Chase had to stop working due to chemotherapy and weekly blood transfusions. He is married with two stepchildren. Mike Guglielmo, New England ambassador for the bone marrow donor center DKMS Americas, is organizing a bone marrow drive today at the Meredith Community Center from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. A second group is conducting a drive tomorrow at Pizzeria Uno in Concord, at 15 Fort Eddy Road, from noon to 6 p.m. The Uno's drive is also a fundraiser, and 20 percent of proceeds from anyone who eats at the restaurant during that time will be given to the Chase family. Getting on the national bone marrow registry requires only a cheek swab.",

    "sentence": "Four homes burglarized in one week. The police are asking the public to be alert after four Hopkinton homes were burglarized during daylight hours this week. Three residences were broken into Wednesday on Farrington Corner Road, just off Jewett Road. The residents were not home at the time of the burglaries, and the thief or thieves made off with electronics and other \"household items,\" according to Hopkinton police Chief David Wheeler, who declined to detail what specific items were taken. Another house was burglarized on Elizabeth Road Thursday, again during the daytime. Wheeler said the police \"definitely\" believe the robberies are connected, and they are stepping up patrols on the town's back roads, as well as communicating with police departments in the region. Hopkinton is the latest town hit in a string of residential burglaries that have occurred over the last several weeks, which Wheeler, in part, attributed to poor economic times. The police in Hillsboro this week arrested two men for allegedly receiving stolen property, and investigators said they believe the men were likely responsible for thefts in several nearby towns. Wheeler asked people to report anything out of the ordinary and to pay special attention to their routines. \"Don't leave keys hidden outside of your homes. Make sure your homes are always locked, and if you go away for a while, call the police and let them know,\" Wheeler said. \"It's the common sense stuff. Don't make it easy for these people.\" Anyone with information about the burglaries is asked to call the Hopkinton Police Department at 746-5151, or the Concord Regional Crimeline at 226-3100.",

    "sentence": "A Marine laid to rest. A cold drizzle fell upon the hundreds of people who gathered to say goodbye to Cpl. Michael Ouellette yesterday. They stood among gravestones at the New Hampshire State Veterans Cemetery in Boscawen, circling the wooden casket that held Ouellette, the 28-year-old Manchester Marine killed last week in Afghanistan. They listened as Alan Ouellette spoke of how his older brother had lived - by reaching out to people - and proposed that friends and family do the same in his memory. They watched as two Marines held an American flag over the casket and began to fold it into crisp triangles, their hands in white gloves, their movements deliberate. Marines came from far away yesterday to honor Ouellette, who was a member of the 3rd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division, II Marine Expeditionary Force. He was killed March 22 while supporting combat operations in Helmand province of southwestern Afghanistan. Another Marine, Cpl. Anthony Williams, 21, of Pennsylvania, was killed the same day. The military hasn't disclosed additional details. Ouellette, who was buried with full military honors, earned seven commendations since joining the Marines in 2005. Afghanistan was his third deployment; he previously served two tours in Iraq. It was during the first tour that Lance Cpl. Christopher Escher came to know him. \"He was always a leader, even as a junior guy,\" Escher said yesterday, recalling the days they spent together on patrol in Anbar province. (\"Every day,\" he said, smiling and shaking his head slightly.) Ouellette became a team leader and then a squad leader, he said. \"He didn't even have to go on this deployment,\" said Escher, who came from Camp Lejeune, N.C., for the service. But \"the guys under him didn't have combat experience.\" Ouellette, he said, wanted to make sure they were taken care of. Ouellette is the 28th person from New Hampshire killed since 2003 while serving in Iraq or Afghanistan. Flags flew at half-staff across the state yesterday. Sen. Judd Gregg mentioned Ouellette on the floor of the U.S. Senate, saying that he'd spoken to Ouellette's mother, \"and of course he was an exceptional individual.\" And Gov. John Lynch came to yesterday's ceremony, standing among the mourners after taps was played. But the crowd yesterday numbered many more than officials and Marines and members of the military. Tai Ahmad, one of Ouellette's closest friends from high school, said many of their Manchester Memorial High School classmates had come to Ouellette's wake and services to pay their respects. \"He had no problems with anybody, not one person I can recall,\" Ahmad said in a conversation last week. \"He was truly, truly, truly just genuine.\" Young men lingered in small circles long after yesterday's service had ended, giving out hugs as they patted each other on the back. They waited in line to walk past Ouellette's casket, under the tarpaulin where his family stood. Alan Ouellette, the younger brother, greeted each person with a handshake and a hug. \"Thank you so much for coming,\" he told one woman as he hugged her tightly. \"I'm proud of my family. They're doing much better than I am.\"",
